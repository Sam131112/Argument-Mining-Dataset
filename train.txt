From	O
this	O

that	O
we	B-ARG

during	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O
through	B-ARG
cooperation,	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
interpersonal	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
significant	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

all	I-ARG

What	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
acquired	I-ARG
from	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
importantly,	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
along	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
.	O
During	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
process	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
cooperation,	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
listen	I-ARG

opinions	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

how	I-ARG

with	I-ARG

how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
comprehensively,	I-ARG

even	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
compromise	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
other	I-ARG

members	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
conflicts	I-ARG
occurred	I-ARG

All	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
these	I-ARG

them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
the	B-ARG
significance	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
competition	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
excellence	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
gain	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
victory	I-ARG

Hence	O
it	O
is	O
always	O
said	O
that	O
competition	B-ARG
makes	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
effective	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
when	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
question	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
win	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
game,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cooperation	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
greater	O
our	O
goal	O
is,	O
the	O
more	O
competition	O
we	O
need	O
.	O
Take	B-ARG
Olympic	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
form	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
competition	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
instance,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
imagine	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
athlete	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
win	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
game	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
training	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
coach,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
professional	I-ARG
staffs	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
diet,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
charge	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
medical	I-ARG
care	I-ARG

The	O
winner	O
is	O
the	O
athlete	O
but	O
the	O
success	O
belongs	O
to	O
the	O
whole	O
team	O
.	O
Therefore	O
without	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
cooperation,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
victory	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
competition	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
no	O
matter	O
from	O
the	O
view	O
of	O
individual	O
development	O
or	O
the	O
relationship	O
between	O
competition	O
and	O
cooperation	O
we	O
can	O
receive	O
the	O

conclusion	O
that	O
a	B-ARG
more	I-ARG
cooperative	I-ARG
attitudes	I-ARG
towards	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
profitable	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
one's	I-ARG
success	I-ARG

More	O
people	O
are	O
migrating	O
to	O
other	O
countries	O
than	O
ever	O
before	O
The	O
last	O
50	O
years	O
have	O
seen	O
an	O
increasing	O
number	O
of	O
immigrants	O
to	O
other	O
countries	O

People	O
moved	O
due	O
to	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
reasons,	O
namely	O
better	O
educations	O
or	O
higher	O
salary	O

.	O
Some	O
people	O
thought	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
follow	O
the	O
local	O
customs	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
integrate	O
into	O
their	O
adopted	O
countries’	O
cultures	O
.	O
However	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
sustain	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
identities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
origin	I-ARG
values	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
maintaining	B-ARG
one’s	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
identity	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
key	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
rule	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
individuals	I-ARG
emerge	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
multicultural	I-ARG
environments	I-ARG
.	O
Take	B-ARG
Australia	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
example,	I-ARG
immigrants	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
varieties	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
nations	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
called	I-ARG
multicultural	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
displaying	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
venues	I-ARG
.	O
Many	B-ARG
Australians	I-ARG
come	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
shows,	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
admire	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
diverse	I-ARG
values	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
feedbacks,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
turn,	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
raise	I-ARG
one’s	I-ARG
pride	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
.	O
Thus	O
this	O
makes	O
it	O
clear	O
that	O
sustaining	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
values	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
immigrants	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
paramount	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
crucial	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
one’s	I-ARG
identity	I-ARG
for	O
they	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
connection	I-ARG
back	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
value	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
origin	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
children	B-ARG
immigrated	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
troubles	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
environment,	I-ARG
parent	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
coming	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
socialize	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
familiar	I-ARG
manner	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
feeling	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
.	O
Fail	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
familiarity	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
felt	I-ARG
isolated,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
extreme	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
disorder	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
autism	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
keeping	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
traditions	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
destination	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
tremendous	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
although	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
opposing	I-ARG
ideas	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
neglecting	I-ARG
one’s	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
values	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
adapt	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
concerned,	O
sustaining	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
traditions	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
immigrated	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
identity	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
give	I-ARG

International	O
tourism	O
is	O
now	O
more	O
common	O
than	O
ever	O
before	O
The	O
last	O
decade	O
has	O
seen	O
an	O
increasing	O
number	O
of	O
tourists	O
traveling	O
to	O
visit	O
natural	O
wonder	O
sights,	O
ancient	O
heritages	O
and	O
different	O
cultures	O
around	O
the	O
world	O
.	O
While	O
some	O
people	O
might	O
think	O
that	O
this	O
international	O
tourism	O
has	O
negative	O
effects	O
on	O
the	O
destination	O
countries,	O
I	O
would	O
contend	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
contributed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
preserved	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tourist	I-ARG
destinations	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
international	B-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
promotes	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
aspects	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
destination	I-ARG
country’s	I-ARG
economy	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
serve	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
demands	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
tourists	I-ARG
.	O
Take	B-ARG
Cambodia	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
example,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
visitors	I-ARG
coming	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
visit	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Angkowat	I-ARG
ancient	I-ARG
temple	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
services	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
restaurants,	I-ARG
hotels,	I-ARG
souvenir	I-ARG
shops	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
stores	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
demands	I-ARG
trigger	I-ARG
related	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
surrounding	I-ARG
settings	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
turn	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
infrastructure	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
standard	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore	O
tourism	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
clearly	I-ARG
improved	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tourist	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
through	B-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
industry,	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
values	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
preserved	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
environments	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
protected	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
in	B-ARG
Vietnam,	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
costumes	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
scenes,	I-ARG
namely	I-ARG
‘Trong	I-ARG
Dong’	I-ARG
drum	I-ARG
performance	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
‘Ha	I-ARG
Long’	I-ARG
bay,	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
encouraged	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
preserve	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
funded	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
ministry	I-ARG
.	O
Without	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
support	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
profit	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
tourism,	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
disappear	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
low	I-ARG
income	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
tourism	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
survived	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
non-tangible	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
values	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
beauty	I-ARG
scenes	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
concerned,	O
international	B-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
triggered	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
maintained	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
values	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tourist	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
the	O
authorities	O
should	O
adequately	O
support	O
these	O
sustainable	O
developments	O

Will	O
newspapers	O

a	O
thing	O
of	O
the	O

The	O

the	O

reasons	O

First	O
of	O
all,	O
to	B-ARG
obtain	I-ARG
information,	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
internet	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
quicker	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
convenient	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
reading	I-ARG
newspapers	I-ARG
.	O
Contrary	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
past	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
wait	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
newspaper,	I-ARG
nowadays,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
acquire	I-ARG
latest	I-ARG
news	I-ARG
updated	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
second	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

connected	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
internet,	I-ARG
everywhere	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
anytime	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
seen,	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
devices	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
machines	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
common	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
parts	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG
making	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
read	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
newspapers	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
pages	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
the	B-ARG
print	I-ARG
media	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
failed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
provision	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
.	O
Another	O
point	O
is	O
that,	O
from	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
aspect,	I-ARG
buying	I-ARG
newspapers	I-ARG
appears	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
waste	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
internet	I-ARG
becomes	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
clear	O
to	O
recognize	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
internet	I-ARG

in	I-ARG

The	O
question	O

as	O

a	O

an	O

the	B-ARG

when	B-ARG

that	O

like	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

a	B-ARG

this	O

In	O
my	O
personal	O
opinion,	O
the	B-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
roommates	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
considered	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
the	O
meantime,	O
communication	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
particularity	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
roommate	I-ARG
.	O
Consideration	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
relationship	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
roommate	B-ARG
turns	I-ARG
down	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
volume	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
night	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
Sometimes	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
done	I-ARG
until	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
taste	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
medicine	I-ARG
.	O
At	B-ARG
all	I-ARG
times,	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
other's	I-ARG
feeling	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
self-centered	I-ARG
action	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
roommate	I-ARG
relationship	I-ARG
tremendously	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
having	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
considered	I-ARG
roommate	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
significantly	I-ARG
imperative	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
conflicts	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
member	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
communication	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
making	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
roommate	I-ARG
.	O
People	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
habit	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
tidy	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
blanket	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
morning	I-ARG
.	O
One	B-ARG
might	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
piece	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
cake	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
immense	I-ARG
project	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
one	I-ARG
requested	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
move	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
his	I-ARG

do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
tidy	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
blanket	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
morning	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
crying	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
split	I-ARG
milk	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
communication	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
as	O
it	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
clear	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
misinterpretation	I-ARG

Through	B-ARG

there	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

There	B-ARG

the	I-ARG

conditions	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
everyday	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
activity:	I-ARG
gradually,	I-ARG
step	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
step	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
change	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
condition	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
entire	I-ARG
nation,	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
ages	I-ARG
begin	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
everyday,	I-ARG
eventually	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
nation	I-ARG
.	O
Besides,	O
when	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
practice	I-ARG
outdoors	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
indoors	I-ARG
sports,	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
aspects	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
clearer	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
when	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
goes	I-ARG
jogging	I-ARG
everyday,	I-ARG
eventually	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
body	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
direct	I-ARG
observation	I-ARG
.	O
Alike,	O
the	B-ARG
school	I-ARG
basketball	I-ARG
team	I-ARG
gains	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
succeed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
particular	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
throwing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ball	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
hoot	I-ARG
practicing	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
theoretically	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
almost	B-ARG
all	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
science	I-ARG
discoveries	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
direct	I-ARG
observation,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
.	O
Last,	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
financial	B-ARG
sustainability	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
region	I-ARG
mostly	I-ARG
depends	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
population	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
the	B-ARG
money	I-ARG
invested	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
program	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
save	I-ARG
allocations	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
healthcare,	I-ARG
since	O
the	B-ARG
nation	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
comparatively	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
.	O
Along	O
with	O
that,	O
physically	B-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
contribute	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
economical	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact,	O
the	B-ARG
better	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
feels,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
brain	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
putting	B-ARG
physical	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
steps	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
finally	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
mentally	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
hence	O
it	B-ARG
ends	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
financially	I-ARG
competitive	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
the	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	B-ARG

attention	I-ARG

withdrawn	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG

Another	B-ARG

many	O
things	O
that	O

However,	O
some	O
people	O
point	O
that	O
technology	O
has	O
made	O
children	O
less	O
creative	O
.	O
I	O
don't	O
deny	O
that	O
technology	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
children,	I-ARG
but	O
I	O
think	O
technology	B-ARG
makes	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
creative	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
technology	B-ARG
inspires	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
.	O
Children	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
curious	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
them,	I-ARG
so	O
when	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
come	I-ARG
across	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
high-tech	I-ARG
product	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
cellphone,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
obsessed	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
mysterious	I-ARG
functions	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
eager	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
Bill	B-ARG
Gates	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
attracted	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
original	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG
computer,	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
worked	I-ARG
.	O
After	B-ARG
he	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
figured	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
stuff,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
began	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
promote	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
computer	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
end,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
successfully	I-ARG
invented	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
computer	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
lightweight	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
instead	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
interfering	I-ARG
children's	I-ARG
creativity,	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
actually	I-ARG
encourages	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
technology	B-ARG
widen	I-ARG
children's	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
past,	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
perspective	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
with	B-ARG
highly	I-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
technology,	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
communicate	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
they	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
thinking	I-ARG
.	O
Knowledge	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
base	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
creativity	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
diverse	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
gained	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
parts	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG
inspires	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
.	O
Admittedly,	O
technology	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
.	O
Technology	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
comfortable	I-ARG
conditions,	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
satisfied	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
refuse	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
change	I-ARG
.	O
Nonetheless,	O
with	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
technology,	I-ARG
increasingly	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
obsessed	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
high-tech	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
kept	I-ARG
researching	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG

became	I-ARG

at	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

students	B-ARG
gain	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

through	I-ARG

learn	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
right	I-ARG

wrong	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
assistance	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

Those	O
who	O
feel	O
that	O
students	B-ARG
learn	I-ARG

more	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
sources,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Internet	I-ARG

firmly	O
believe	O
that	O
within	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
sources	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
lots	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can't	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
input	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
key	I-ARG

google	I-ARG
it,	I-ARG

To	O
begin	O
with,	O
it	B-ARG

something	I-ARG

Emergence	B-ARG

television	I-ARG

surprising	I-ARG

We	B-ARG
kill	I-ARG
time	I-ARG

these	I-ARG

at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

we	I-ARG

This	B-ARG

Second,	O
I	O
think	O
watching	B-ARG

We	B-ARG
usually	I-ARG

eight-hour	I-ARG

Hence,	O
we	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG

healthy	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

Every	B-ARG

To	O
conclude,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O

must	I-ARG
open	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
select	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG

Our	B-ARG
youth	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
confident	I-ARG
towards	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
ready	I-ARG

bound	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
limitations	I-ARG

Female	B-ARG
candidates	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
restriction	I-ARG
posed	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
employer	I-ARG

So	O
we	B-ARG
must	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
.	O

Some	O
young	O
adults	O
want	O
independence	O
from	O
their	O
parents	O
quickly	O
Many	O
young	O

want	O

as	O
possible	O
in	O

But	O
these	O

do	O
not	O
take	O
into	O
account	O
that	O
their	B-ARG
lives	I-ARG

more	I-ARG

when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG

away	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
bills,	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

in	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

they	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
like	I-ARG

Living	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
houses	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
save	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
separate	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
loan,	I-ARG
electricity,	I-ARG
water	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
meal	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
combine	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
working,	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
worries	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
home,	I-ARG
because	O
parents	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
parents	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

money	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
focus	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
.	O
Another	B-ARG
problem	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
encounter	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
co-tenant,	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
.	O
His	B-ARG
habits	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
totally	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
theirs,	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
inappropriate,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
share	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
room,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
expenses	I-ARG
.	O
Living	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
co-tenant	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
share	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
interests	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
points	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
view,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
ask	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
advice	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
quarrel	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
day,	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
reckon	O
that	O
for	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents,	I-ARG
because	O
of	O
the	O
benefits	O
they	O
will	O
have	O
.	O
They	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
worry	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
if	I-ARG

Air	O

Air	O

an	O

I	O

that	O
more	B-ARG

as	I-ARG
paying	I-ARG

up	I-ARG

.	O
First,	O
in	B-ARG
most	I-ARG
industrialized	I-ARG
countries,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
holds	I-ARG
heavy	I-ARG
factories	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
constitutions	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
waste	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
harmful	I-ARG
gases	I-ARG
produced	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
factories	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
significant	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
air	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
.	O
While	B-ARG
these	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
businesses,	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
considering	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
precautions	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
air	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
these	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
obliged	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
clean	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
air	I-ARG
pollution,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
at	I-ARG

make	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
effort	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
air	I-ARG

they	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
private	B-ARG
individuals	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
air	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
inessential	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
cars	I-ARG

house	I-ARG

As	B-ARG
house	I-ARG
heating	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
major	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
winter	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
households	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG

use	I-ARG
filters	I-ARG

reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Instead	O

this,	O
some	B-ARG

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
by	B-ARG
charging	I-ARG
private	I-ARG
individuals	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

that	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O

pollution	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
individuals	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG

Governments	B-ARG
also	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
budgets	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
clean	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

When	B-ARG

their	I-ARG

will	I-ARG
get	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
reason	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
some	I-ARG

problems,	I-ARG
typically	I-ARG
shortsighted	I-ARG

children	B-ARG

on	I-ARG

can	I-ARG
seriously	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG

For	O

several	B-ARG
teenagers	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
rest,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
depression,	I-ARG
a	B-ARG
typical	I-ARG
example	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
death	I-ARG

even	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG

Some	B-ARG

my	O
point	O

view,	O
the	B-ARG
advantages	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
a	B-ARG
large	I-ARG
factory	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
stimulate	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
growth	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
unemployment	I-ARG
rate	I-ARG
.	O
To	B-ARG
manufacture	I-ARG
goods,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
must	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
demand	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

from	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG

benefit	I-ARG

What	O
is	O
more,	O
the	B-ARG
factory	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
isolated,	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
industries	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
quickly	I-ARG
established,	I-ARG
resulting	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
growth	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
area	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
the	B-ARG
estate	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
boosted	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
satisfy	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
workers'	I-ARG
accommodation	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
main	I-ARG
disadvantage	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
contamination	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
true	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
area	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
suffering	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
dire	I-ARG
consequences	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
overdeveloping	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

water	I-ARG

medical	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG

For	O

in	B-ARG
some	I-ARG
industrial	I-ARG
cities,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
proportion	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
workers	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
suffering	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
breathing	I-ARG
problems,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG

However,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
inevitable	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
will	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
how	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
disadvantages	I-ARG

it	I-ARG

In	O
fact	O
most	B-ARG

Some	O
ingredients	B-ARG

developed	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
unwilling	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
share	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
successful	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
education,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
developing	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
remain	I-ARG
undeveloped,	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
though	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
gain	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
support	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
the	B-ARG
critical	I-ARG
method	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
condition	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
poor	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
complete	I-ARG
educational	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
aid	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
it	O
is	O
well	O
acknowledged	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
free	O
lunch	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O
This	O
means	O
some	B-ARG
powerful	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
support	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
acquire	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
exploit	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
target	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
labour	I-ARG
market	I-ARG
.	O
Indeed,	O
they	B-ARG
rarely	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
residents	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
technological	I-ARG
aid	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
contamination	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
developing	B-ARG
countries	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
totally	I-ARG
depend	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
support	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
powerful	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
financial	B-ARG
aid	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
assist	I-ARG
poor	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
.	O
And	O
it	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
proven	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
developing	I-ARG
education	I-ARG

improving	I-ARG
national	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG

Society	B-ARG
does	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

what	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O
I	O
do	O
support	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O

alcohol,	I-ARG
cigarettes,	I-ARG
goods	I-ARG

with	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
content	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
prohibited	I-ARG

these	B-ARG

of	I-ARG

will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effect	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
children	I-ARG

Youngsters	B-ARG
might	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
tempted	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
buy	I-ARG
cigarettes	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
alcohol	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
later	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
start	I-ARG
consume	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
basis	I-ARG
.	O
Fortunately,	O
some	B-ARG
countries	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
issue	I-ARG
seriously	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
alcohol,	I-ARG
cigarettes	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
materials	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
content	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
banned	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
by	B-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
companies,	I-ARG
businesses,	I-ARG
firms	I-ARG

individuals	I-ARG
promote	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
goods	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
services	I-ARG
.	O
Thanks	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
ads	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
products,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
compare	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
what’s	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
days,	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
businesses,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
governments	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
rely	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
tourism	B-ARG
makes	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
one-third	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Czech	I-ARG
Republic's	I-ARG
economy	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
promote	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
country's	I-ARG
attractions,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Czech	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
advertise	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
sell	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
services	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
consumers	I-ARG
.	O
Only	B-ARG
well	I-ARG
planned	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
targeted	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
tourists	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
modern	B-ARG
society	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
.	O
Ads	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
informed	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
services,	I-ARG
but	O
we	O
should	O
also	O
bear	O
in	O
mind	O
that	O
advertising	B-ARG
cigarettes	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
alcohol	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
definitely	I-ARG
affect	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
.	O

Do	O
married	O
women	O
usually	O
work?	O
Why	O
and	O
why	O
not?	O
Personally,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
married	B-ARG
women	I-ARG
nowadays	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
men	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
employment	I-ARG
discrimination	I-ARG
based	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
gender	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
erased	I-ARG
significantly	I-ARG
.	O
Working	B-ARG
outside	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
married	I-ARG
woman	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
household	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
will	O
mention	O
some	O
basic	O
reasons	O
as	O
following	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
extra	B-ARG
income	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
women	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
contribute	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
family's	I-ARG
expenses	I-ARG
.	O
By	B-ARG
taking	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
wife	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
support	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
cases	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
husband's	I-ARG
low	I-ARG
salary	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
difficulty	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
present	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
normal	I-ARG
practice	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
women	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
helpmates	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
earning	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
working	B-ARG
outside	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
house	I-ARG
creates	I-ARG
opportunities	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
married	I-ARG
women	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
contact	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
outer	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG
strengthen	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
character	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
capacity	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
things	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
turn	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
confident,	I-ARG
independent	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
women	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
set	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
example	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
doubt	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
roles	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
mother	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
wife	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
nowadays,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
supporting	I-ARG
conditions	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
women	I-ARG
balance	I-ARG
housework	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
Besides	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
gorvernment's	I-ARG
policies	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
limited	I-ARG
families	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
husbands'	I-ARG
sharing	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
housework,	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
employers	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
willing	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
offer	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
women	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
a	B-ARG
well-organized	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
housewife's	I-ARG
presence	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
and	O
married	B-ARG
women	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
outside	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
.	O

Government	O
and	O

knowledge	O
and	O
skills	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
this	O

.	O
I	O
completely	O
agree	O
that	O
government	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
people;	I-ARG
however,	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
university,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fees	I-ARG
.	O
Some	B-ARG
parents	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
fees	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
I	B-ARG
don't	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
fair	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
paying	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
primary	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
secondary	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
receive	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
students	B-ARG
that	I-ARG
already	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parent	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
afford	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
responsible	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fees	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition	O
to	O
that,	O
the	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
independent	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
characters	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
marketplace	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
this	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

future	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
completely	O
agree	O
that	O
government	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
fees	I-ARG
because	O
this	B-ARG
will	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
charge	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

themselves	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
just	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Alternative	O
forms	O

Recently,	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
attention	O
has	O
been	O
paid	O
to	O
means	O
of	O
transportation	O
.	O
Some	O
state	O
that	O

is	O
the	O
most	O

while	O

that	O

should	O

considered	O
in	O
view	O
of	O

.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
strongly	O
agree	O
that	O
alternative	B-ARG
means	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
laws	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
controlling	I-ARG
automobiles	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
introduced	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
this	O
essay,	O
several	O
reasons	O
will	O
be	O
described	O
carefully	O
in	O
the	O
following	O
passages	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
an	B-ARG
increase	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
automobiles	I-ARG
brings	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
.	O
Since	O
automobile	B-ARG
exhaust	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
carbon	I-ARG
dioxides	I-ARG
emission	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
impacts	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
air,	I-ARG
the	B-ARG
air	I-ARG
gets	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
polluted	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
causes	I-ARG
respiratory	I-ARG
disease	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
inhabitants	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
crucial	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
alter	I-ARG
automobiles	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
legislate	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
control	I-ARG
automobiles	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
an	B-ARG
increase	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
automobiles	I-ARG
causes	I-ARG
terrible	I-ARG
traffic	I-ARG
congestion	I-ARG
.	O
Once	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
traffic	I-ARG
jam,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
forces	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
waste	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
.	O
What	O
is	O
worse,	O
traffic	B-ARG
congestion	I-ARG
irritates	I-ARG
drivers	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
result,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
traffic	I-ARG
accidents	I-ARG
.	O

the	B-ARG

However,	O

the	O
fact	O

falseful	I-ARG

true	O
that	O

They	B-ARG

Advertising	B-ARG

helps	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
prices	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
reasonable	I-ARG
levels,	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
power	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
maybe	I-ARG
over-rated,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
deny	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
final	I-ARG
decision	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
on	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
us	I-ARG

No	O
matter	O
how	O

Gun	O
control	O
Gun	O
is	O
definitely	O
not	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
normal	O
good	O
in	O
our	O
society,	O
which	O
is	O
strictly	O
controlled	O
in	O
most	O
countries	O
.	O
However,	O
gun	O
control	O
in	O
some	O
countries	O
is	O
relatively	O
loose	O
than	O
others	O
.	O
Therefore,	O
this	O
is	O
still	O
a	O
controversial	O
topic	O
around	O
the	O
world	O
.	O
From	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
sensible	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
enforce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
gun	I-ARG
control	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
first	O
factor	O
considered	O
is	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
accidents	O
with	O
guns	O
.	O
The	B-ARG
accidents	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
completely	I-ARG
avoided	I-ARG
although	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
gun	I-ARG
licenses	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
purchase	I-ARG
guns	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
we	B-ARG
hear	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
news	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
hurt	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
accident	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
hunting	I-ARG
.	O
So	O
the	B-ARG
fewer	I-ARG
guns	I-ARG
possessed,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fewer	I-ARG
accidents	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
happened,	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
surroundings	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
safer	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
lower	I-ARG
accident	I-ARG
rates	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
most	B-ARG
violent	I-ARG
crimes	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
related	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
abuse	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
guns,	I-ARG
especially	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
guns	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
Eventually,	O
guns	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
trend	I-ARG
continues	I-ARG
.	O
Take	O
an	O
example,	O
in	B-ARG
American,	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
juveniles	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
access	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
guns,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tragedies	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
gun	I-ARG
shooting	I-ARG
.	O
What	O
is	O
worse,	O
some	B-ARG
terrorists	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
possess	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
weapons	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
police,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
danger	I-ARG
.	O
Thirdly,	O
the	B-ARG
possession	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
guns	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
raise	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rates	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
suicide	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
US,	I-ARG
firearms	I-ARG
remain	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
common	I-ARG
method	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
suicide,	I-ARG
accounting	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
50	I-ARG
per	I-ARG
cent	I-ARG
.	O
Unfortunately,	O
there	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
increasing	I-ARG
trend	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
adolescent	I-ARG
suicides	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
suicides	I-ARG
among	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
75	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
considering	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
rise	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
accident	I-ARG
rates,	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
rates	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
suicide	I-ARG
rates,	I-ARG
I	O
support	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
guns	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
strictly	I-ARG
limited	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
enforce	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
series	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
laws	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
societies	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
violence	I-ARG

Besides	O

advantages	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

technology	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
root	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
gap	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
the	B-ARG
good	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
bringing	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
undeniable	I-ARG
.	O
Under	B-ARG
proper	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
technology,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG

Why	O
should	O
human	O
beings	O
travel	O
to	O
outer	O
space?	O
For	O
many	O
centuries,	O
outer	O
space	O
has	O
been	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
favourable	O
realms	O
of	O
study	O
.	O
Space	O
expeditions	O
have	O
been	O
launched	O
and	O
many	O
have	O
been	O
successful	O
.	O
However,	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
still	O
consider	O
space	O
exploration	O
as	O
an	O
act	O
of	O
wasting	O
money,	O
to	O
illustrate,	O
astronauts	O
only	O
brought	O
useless	O
rocks	O
back	O
to	O
planet	O
earth	O
despite	O
the	O
large	O
sum	O
of	O
money	O
spent	O
on	O
their	O
equipment	O
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
reasons	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
beings	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
travel	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
outer	I-ARG
space	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
many	B-ARG
facts	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
solar	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
discovered	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
a	B-ARG
picture	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
planet	I-ARG
earth	I-ARG
proved	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
earth	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
round,	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
flat	I-ARG
.	O
Another	O
example	O
is	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
earth	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
goes	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
sun,	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
vice	I-ARG
versa	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
it	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
space	I-ARG
exploration,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
facts	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
people	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
planet	I-ARG
earth	I-ARG
itself	I-ARG
.	O
By	B-ARG
observing	I-ARG
planet	I-ARG
earth	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
outer	I-ARG
space,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
ample	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
example	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
atmosphere	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
planet	I-ARG
earth	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
knowledge,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
something	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
earth	I-ARG
hazards	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
global	I-ARG
warming	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
a	B-ARG
great	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
sophisticated	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
invented	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
astronauts	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
travel	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
outer	I-ARG
space	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
oxygen	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
breathe	I-ARG
in,	I-ARG
scientists	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
compelled	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
oxygen	I-ARG
tanks	I-ARG
.	O
Oxygen	B-ARG
tanks,	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
instance,	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
proved	I-ARG
useful	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
outer	I-ARG
space	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
underwater	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
spaceships,	B-ARG
communication	I-ARG
satellites	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
space	I-ARG
pens	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
contribute	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
personally	O
think	O
that	O
human	B-ARG
beings	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
travel	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
outer	I-ARG
space	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
spite	O
of	O
costing	O
a	O
fortune,	O
space	O
exploration	O
has	O
given	O
aforementioned	O
benefits	O

Benefits	O
of	O
students	O
doing	O
extra	O
jobs	O
In	O

students	O
are	O

This	O

I	O
feel	O

that	O
the	O

In	O
this	O

some	O
of	O
the	O
benefits	O
surrounding	O
this	O

will	O
be	O
carefully	O
explained	O
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
undoubtedly	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
gain	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
practical	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
involved	I-ARG
extra	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
.	O
Part-time	B-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
furnish	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
precious	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
practice	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
universities	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
that	B-ARG
seems	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
present	I-ARG
shortage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
sufficiently	I-ARG
practical	I-ARG
conditions	I-ARG
supplied	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
universities	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
students	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
hands-on	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
having	B-ARG
experienced	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
offers	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
distinct	I-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
apply	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
graduation	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
students	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
confident	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
independent	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
ones	I-ARG
.	O
By	B-ARG
constant	I-ARG
communicating	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
colleagues	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
ideas	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
raised	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
hesitation,	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
confidence	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
significantly	I-ARG
gained	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
working	B-ARG
conditions	I-ARG
require	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
independency	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
thinking,	I-ARG
working,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
solving	I-ARG
problems,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
greatly	I-ARG
helpful	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
characteristic	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
applied	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
tackle	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
universities	I-ARG
.	O
Lastly,	O
doing	B-ARG
extra	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
accommodation	I-ARG
.	O
Indeed,	O
high	B-ARG
studying	I-ARG
tuition,	I-ARG
added	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
raising	I-ARG
accommodation	I-ARG
expenses	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
becoming	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG
burden	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
extra	I-ARG
jobs,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
normally	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
much,	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
difficulties	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
partially	I-ARG
solved	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
that	B-ARG
helps	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
reliant	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
families	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
well-prepared	I-ARG
condition	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
independent	I-ARG
later	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
feel	O
certain	O
that	O
having	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
offer	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
clear	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG
.	O
By	B-ARG
taking	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
extra	I-ARG
job,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
partly	I-ARG
alleviate	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
problematic	I-ARG
matters	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
experience,	I-ARG
confidence	I-ARG

It	O
is	O
my	O
belief	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

In	B-ARG
most	I-ARG

For	O
this	O
reason,	O
the	B-ARG
internship,	I-ARG
although	I-ARG

can	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG
that	I-ARG

As	B-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
unpaid	I-ARG
interns	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
no	I-ARG

save	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
money	I-ARG

In	O
addition,	O
the	B-ARG
younger	I-ARG
generations	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
generate	I-ARG

ideas	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
bound	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
restricted	I-ARG
workload	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
tend	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
greater	I-ARG
imagination,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
essentially	I-ARG
helpful	I-ARG

This	O

Firstly,	O
during	B-ARG
times	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
war,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
badly	I-ARG
affected	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
forget	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
gloomy	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
maintain	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
link	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rest	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
listening	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
event	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
when	B-ARG
Irak	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
hardly	I-ARG
struck	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Second	I-ARG
Gulf	I-ARG
War,	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG
tried	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
catch	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
incoming	I-ARG
news	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
FootballWorld	I-ARG
Cup	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
portable	I-ARG
receivers	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
clearly	O
shows	O
that	O
international	B-ARG
sports	I-ARG
competitions	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
come	I-ARG
back,	I-ARG
sooner	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
later,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

peaceful	I-ARG
normality	I-ARG

Thus,	O
world	B-ARG
sports	I-ARG
events	I-ARG
strongly	I-ARG
participate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
eventually	I-ARG
pulling	I-ARG
back	I-ARG

towards	I-ARG
friendship	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
these	B-ARG

The	O

the	O

more	O
energy	O
than	O
in	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
believed	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
various	O
other	O
resources	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
nuclear	O
and	O
solar	O
which	O
are	O
abundant	O
and	O
eco-friendly	O
.	O
I	O
will	O
analyze	O
these	O
areas	O
in	O
the	O
essay	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
the	B-ARG
major	I-ARG
source	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
today	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
water	I-ARG
.	O
Although	O
there	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
water	I-ARG
shortage	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
generate	I-ARG
electricity	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
rely	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
source	I-ARG
.	O
To	B-ARG
generate	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
vast	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fundamental	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
falling	I-ARG
short	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
during	B-ARG
summer	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
power	I-ARG
cut	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
developing	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
India	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
nuclear,	I-ARG
solar	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
wind	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
distributing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
required	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
electricity	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
it	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
implication	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
generate	I-ARG
electricity	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
sources	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
the	B-ARG
sources	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
widely	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
currently	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
generate	I-ARG
power	I-ARG
releases	I-ARG
extensive	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
gases	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
atmosphere	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
increases	I-ARG
global	I-ARG
warming	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
the	B-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
solar	I-ARG
cooker	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
electric	I-ARG
cooker	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
certainly	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
global	I-ARG
warming	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
the	O
same	O
way,	O
the	B-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
nuclear	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
alternative	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
hydro-kinetic	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
causes	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
atmospheric	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
it	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
implication	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
promote	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
sources	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
turn	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
global	I-ARG
warming	I-ARG
.	O
Further,	O
government	O
should	O
motivate	O
and	O
encourage	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
use	O
alternative	O
sources	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
solar	O
and	O
the	O
nuclear	O
energy	O
.	O

Should	O
governments	O
be	O
responsible	O
to	O
help	O
the	O
unemployed	O
and	O
homeless	O
Unemployment	O
is	O
clearly	O
a	O
global	O
problem,	O
be	O
it	O
in	O
developed	O
countries	O
or	O
developing	O
ones	O
.	O
However,	O
I	O
tend	O
to	O
believe	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
disadvantaged	I-ARG
citizens,	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
.	O
Government	B-ARG
money	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
spent	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
publicly	I-ARG
beneficial	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
.	O
Tax	B-ARG
revenue	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
collected	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
.	O
Spending	B-ARG
them	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
helping	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
contribution	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
sound	I-ARG
fair	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
tax	I-ARG
payers	I-ARG
.	O
Besides,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
pressing	I-ARG
demands	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
expenditure,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
service	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
education,	I-ARG
so	O
addressing	B-ARG
unemployment	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
low	I-ARG
priority	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
it	O
is	O
obvious	O
that,	O
to	B-ARG
survive	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
competitive	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
equip	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
motivation	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
.	O
Of	O
course,	O
this	B-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
mean	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
assistance	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
already	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
reverse	I-ARG
circumstances	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
overcome	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
difficulties	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
external	I-ARG
support	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
this	O
case,	O
the	B-ARG
government	I-ARG
ought	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
set	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
vocational	I-ARG
trainings	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
interest-free	I-ARG
bank	I-ARG
loans	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them,	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
back	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
After	O
all,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
beneficial	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
jobless	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
contribution	I-ARG
again	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
my	O
point	O

view	O
is	O
that,	O
although	O
the	B-ARG
government	I-ARG
should	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
disadvantaged	I-ARG

A	B-ARG

all	I-ARG

reasons:	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
degree	I-ARG
that's	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
widely	I-ARG
accepted,	I-ARG
gain	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
insight	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
an	I-ARG

simply	I-ARG
deepen	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
research	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG

On	O
the	O

the	B-ARG

From	O
my	O
perspective,	O
animals	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
habitats	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
zoos	I-ARG

To	O
begin	O
with,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

species	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
away	I-ARG

.	O
Given	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
fact	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
human	I-ARG

responsible	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
heavy	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
severe	I-ARG
damage	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
habitats	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
wild	I-ARG
animals,	I-ARG
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
safe	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
.	O
Apparently,	O
the	B-ARG
limited	I-ARG
space	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
artificial	I-ARG
trees	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
lakes	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
fully	I-ARG
compensate	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
loss	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
if	B-ARG
rural	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
captured	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
zoo	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
period,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
influences	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
psychological	I-ARG
status	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
creatures	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
the	B-ARG
wild	I-ARG
species	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
suffer	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
isolation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
depression	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
seems	O
that	O
zoos	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
killer	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
protector	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

Nevertheless,	O
supporters	O
would	O
argue	O
that	O
zoos,	B-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
equipped	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG

would	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
better	I-ARG

They	O
further	O

out	O
that	O
the	B-ARG

never	I-ARG

However,	O
I	O
would	O
contend	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
strict	I-ARG

provide	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

various	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

It	O
seems	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
growing	I-ARG
number	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
widely	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
among	I-ARG
colleges	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
terms	I-ARG

In	B-ARG
earlier	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Now,	B-ARG
however,	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

global	I-ARG
business	I-ARG

With	B-ARG
the	I-ARG

it	B-ARG

it	O

that	O

Anyone	B-ARG

Consequently,	O

In	O
this	O

give	O
my	O
opinion	O
for	O
both	O
sides	O

It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
obvious	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
power	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
positively	I-ARG
influence	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
psychology	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
many	B-ARG
university	I-ARG
authorities	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
lessons	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
so	O
that	O
they	B-ARG
live	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
harmony	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
have	O
an	O
impression	O
that	O
students,	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
cope	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
gained	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
this	O
case,	O
music	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
useful	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
interesting	I-ARG
solution	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
if	B-ARG
musical	I-ARG
activity	I-ARG
involves	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
participants,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
co-operation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
developed	I-ARG
team	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
group,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is,	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
course,	I-ARG
beneficial	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
students	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
quite	I-ARG
poor	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
background	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
the	B-ARG
calm	I-ARG
atmosphere	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
created	I-ARG
.	O
By	O
contrast,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
clear	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
mentally	I-ARG
enhancing	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
our	O
hectic	O
life,	O
however,	O
demand	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
musically	I-ARG
orientated	I-ARG
students,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
academically	I-ARG
developed	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
majority,	O
because	O
music	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
requires	I-ARG
special	I-ARG
attitude	I-ARG
towards	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
Increasingly	O
however,	O
students	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
obtain	I-ARG
supposed	I-ARG
impacts,	I-ARG
unless	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
interested	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
seriously	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
music	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
entertaining	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
optional	I-ARG
.	O
Nowadays,	B-ARG
time	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
increased	I-ARG
pace	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
my	O
mind,	O
students	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
professional	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
occupation-related	I-ARG

these	O

In	O
my	O
opinion	O
universities	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
invest	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
libraries	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
anywhere	I-ARG
else	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
I	O
think	O
a	B-ARG
library	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
vital	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
strategical	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
.	O
All	B-ARG
professors	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
well-equipped	I-ARG
library	I-ARG
because,	O
after	B-ARG
internet,	I-ARG
library	I-ARG
plays	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
.	O
Although	O
sport	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
important,	I-ARG
it	B-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
priority	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
library	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition	O
only	B-ARG
small	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
sport	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
library	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
usually	B-ARG
libraries	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
income	I-ARG
.	O
Most	B-ARG
libraries	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
universities	B-ARG
support	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
vital	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
libraries	I-ARG
.	O
But	O
sport	B-ARG
activities	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
income	I-ARG
because	O
every	B-ARG
sport	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
matches	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
match	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
sponsors	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
sell	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
matches	I-ARG
tickets	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
compensate	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
expenses,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

way	I-ARG

an	I-ARG
income	I-ARG

Last	O
but	O
not	O

long-time	I-ARG
result	I-ARG

Human	B-ARG

For	O

cows	B-ARG

the	I-ARG

On	O
the	O

the	B-ARG
importance	I-ARG

plain	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

First	O

the	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
benefits	I-ARG

easily	I-ARG
recognized	I-ARG

In	O
the	O
first	O
place,	O
with	B-ARG
some	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG

Teenagers	B-ARG

In	B-ARG
students'	I-ARG
point	I-ARG

view,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
combination	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG

easy	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG

However,	O
still	B-ARG
many	I-ARG

cannot	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
variation	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

they	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

so	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
homework	I-ARG

exams	I-ARG

Besides,	O
most	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
regard	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
extra	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
useless	I-ARG

impractical	I-ARG

Those	O
who	O
advocate	O

on	O
one	O

believe	O
that	O
this	B-ARG
education	I-ARG
model	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
cultivate	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
talents	I-ARG

specialized	I-ARG

different	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG

increase	I-ARG

effectiveness	I-ARG

This	O
is	O
probably	O
because	O
students	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
devote	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
efforts	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG

reduce	I-ARG

However,	O
the	O
drawbacks	O
of	O
this	O

method	O
cannot	O
be	O
neglected	O
.	O
Most	O
importantly,	O
under	B-ARG
such	I-ARG
target-oriented	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
environment,	I-ARG
teenagers	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
regret	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
original	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG

change	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
specialized	I-ARG
field	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
further	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
the	B-ARG
dullness	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
deeply	I-ARG
influence	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
passion	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
study	I-ARG

It	O
is	O
undeniable	O
that	O
concentrating	B-ARG
on	I-ARG
one	I-ARG

can	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
foster	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
effectiveness	I-ARG

A	B-ARG

prove	I-ARG
detrimental	I-ARG

When	B-ARG

work	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
these	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG

my	B-ARG

When	B-ARG

smoking	I-ARG

how	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
utilize	I-ARG

A	B-ARG

among	O
those	O
reasons	O
are	O
two	O
important	O
ones	O
.	O
The	O
first	O
and	O
foremost	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
with	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
science	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
technology,	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
kitchen	I-ARG
facilities,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
microwaves	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
cookers,	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
created	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
invented	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG

cook	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
short	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
people	B-ARG
nowadays	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
hour	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
meal	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
two,	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
three	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
last	I-ARG
10	I-ARG
years	I-ARG
.	O
Actually,	O
in	B-ARG
recent	I-ARG
years,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
significant	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
walks	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
realizing	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
technologies	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
housework	I-ARG
.	O
And	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
figure	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
continuously	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
along	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
improvement	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
science	I-ARG

technology	I-ARG

Thus,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
spending	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
cooking	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
trend	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
near	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
.	O
Another	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
most	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
meals	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
restaurants	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
invest	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
time	I-ARG

work	I-ARG

According	O
to	O
a	O
recent	O
survey,	O
89%	B-ARG
of	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
come	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
that,	I-ARG
since	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
put	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
situation	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
filled	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
competitions	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
hard,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
update	I-ARG

acquire	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG

so	I-ARG
on	I-ARG

Thus,	O
they	B-ARG
find	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
cook	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
meal	I-ARG

Even	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
spare	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG

relax	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
relieve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
.	O
Some	O
people	O
may	O
argue	O
that	O
investing	B-ARG
much	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
cooking	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
guarantee	I-ARG
nutrition	I-ARG

as	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
some	O
extent,	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
.	O
However,	O
as	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
matter	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
fact,	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
lose	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
nutrition	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
.	O
Even,	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
ozone	I-ARG
machines,	I-ARG
bacterias,	I-ARG
mold	I-ARG
spores,	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
pesticide	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
vegetables,	I-ARG
fruits	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
foods	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
killed	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
removed,	I-ARG
thus	O
health	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
eaters	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
assured	I-ARG
.	O
Besides,	O
along	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
standard,	I-ARG
requirements	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
almost	I-ARG

nowadays,	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
under	I-ARG
severe	I-ARG
control	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
supervision	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
appropriate	I-ARG
authorities	I-ARG

Consequently,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
quite	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
nutritious	I-ARG
meal	I-ARG

games,	I-ARG
which,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
fact,	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
acquire	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
particularly	I-ARG
powerful	I-ARG
skill	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
.	O
At	O
the	O
same	O
time,	O
children	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
state-of-the-art	I-ARG

raising	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
awareness	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
innovation	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
stay	I-ARG
conservative	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
I	O
think	O
traditional	B-ARG
games	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
indispensible	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
children's	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
process,	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
games,	I-ARG
especially	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
.	O
One	B-ARG
primary	I-ARG
merit	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
foster	I-ARG
children's	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
.	O
Unlike	B-ARG
most	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
focus	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
interactions	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
machines,	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
relaxing	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
enjoyable	I-ARG
atmosphere	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
chat,	I-ARG
laugh	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
cooperate	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
communicating	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
variety	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
issue	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
educational	I-ARG
functions	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
hold	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
alive	I-ARG
today	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
these	B-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
elaborately	I-ARG
devised	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
educators	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
proven	I-ARG
effective	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
improving	I-ARG
children's	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
aspects	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
previous	I-ARG
teaching	I-ARG
practices	I-ARG
.	O
By	O
contrast,	O
modern	B-ARG
games	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
developed	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
game	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
purpose	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
profits	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
there	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
risk	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
exposed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
unhealthy	I-ARG
contents,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
violence	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
pornography,	I-ARG
arranged	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
secure	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
survival	I-ARG

Thus,	O
I	O
would	O
conclude	O
that	O
traditional	B-ARG
games	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be,	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
no	I-ARG

Only	B-ARG
through	I-ARG

thousands	I-ARG

citizens	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
suffer	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
disease	I-ARG

more	I-ARG
urgent	I-ARG
and	I-ARG

As	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact,	O
an	B-ARG
uneducated	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
barely	I-ARG
appreciate	I-ARG
musicals,	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

resulting	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

no	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
participate	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
providing	B-ARG
education	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
prioritized	I-ARG

Entertaining	B-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
such	I-ARG

their	I-ARG
marketing	I-ARG
strategies,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
condition	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
volume	I-ARG

audience	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
competition	I-ARG
among	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
inevitable	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
market,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
interfered	I-ARG
by	I-ARG

Instead,	O
the	B-ARG
establishment	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
medical	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
educational	I-ARG
institutes	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
aimed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
standard	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
earning	I-ARG
profits,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
deserves	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
funds	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
putting	B-ARG
taxpayers'	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
building	I-ARG
theaters	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
stadiums	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
unfair	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
those	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bit	I-ARG
inappropriate	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
majority	I-ARG

reason	O

with	B-ARG

many	B-ARG

On	O
the	O

some	B-ARG

have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
detrimental	I-ARG
effect	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG

They	O
argue	O
that	O
people,	O
especially	B-ARG

are	I-ARG
crazier	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
fresh	I-ARG

advanced	I-ARG
things,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
digital	I-ARG

thus	I-ARG
becoming	I-ARG
indifferent	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG

But	O
I	O
believe	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
issue	O

I	O

On	O
the	O

pollutions	B-ARG

the	B-ARG

problems	I-ARG

Primarily,	O
authorities	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
spare	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
efforts	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
improving	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG

such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
constructing	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

reducing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

Furthermore,	O
temporarily	B-ARG
targets	I-ARG

Meanwhile,	O
cultivating	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
sense	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG

also	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
out,	I-ARG
though	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
might	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

it	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
wise	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
addressing	B-ARG
pollution	I-ARG

traffic	I-ARG
issues	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
increasing	I-ARG
oil	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
adequate,	I-ARG
while	O
improving	O
transportation	O

Is	O

powerful	O
than	O
the	O
written	O
word?	O
"A	O

a	O

is	O
a	O

for	O
a	O
very	O

the	O
power	O
of	O

in	O
conveying	O

Nevertheless,	O
the	O
importance	O

that	O

Hence,	O
I	B-ARG
agree	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
degree	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
today's	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG

serves	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
effective	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
pictures	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
influence	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
nowadays	B-ARG
horrendous	I-ARG
images	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
displayed	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cigarette	I-ARG
boxes	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
illustrate	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
consequences	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
statistics	B-ARG
show	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
slight	I-ARG
reduction	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
smokers,	I-ARG
indicating	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
realize	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
habit	I-ARG
.	O
Not	O
only	O
that,	O
the	B-ARG
magnificent	I-ARG
photograph	I-ARG
captured	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
Kevin	I-ARG
Carter,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
portrayed	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
starving	I-ARG
Sudanese	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
struck	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
extreme	I-ARG
poverty	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
successfully	I-ARG
highlighted	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
plight	I-ARG
faced	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
Sudan	I-ARG
.	O
Apart	O
from	O
that,	O
images	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
widely	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
newspapers,	I-ARG
magazines	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
advertisements	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
undeniable	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
images	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
absence	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
words	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
obviously	I-ARG
claim	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
attraction	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
.	O
Looking	O
from	O
another	O
perspective,	O
written	B-ARG
words	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
vital	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spread	I-ARG
across	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
messages	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
only	I-ARG
pictures,	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
left	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
interpretation	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
perceive	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
images	I-ARG
.	O
Nonetheless,	O
this	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
words	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
explain	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
illustration	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
the	B-ARG
primary	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
educating	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
.	O
Academic	B-ARG
textbooks	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
days	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
laden	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
words	I-ARG
besides	I-ARG
pictures	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
guide	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
readers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
comprehend	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
both	B-ARG
images	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
words	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
hand	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
hand	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
wholly	I-ARG
emphasise	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
aspect,	I-ARG
either	I-ARG
images	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
words	I-ARG

Hence,	O
for	O
a	O
more	O
meaningful	O
communication,	O
these	O
two	O
elements	O
have	O
their	O
respective	O
roles	O
to	O

this	O

First	O
and	O
foremost,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
realize	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
languages,	I-ARG

are	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
quite	I-ARG
major	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
country	I-ARG

and	I-ARG
even	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

The	B-ARG

that	I-ARG

should	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
keeping	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
preserving	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rich	I-ARG

of	I-ARG

which	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
our	I-ARG

more	I-ARG

What	O
is	O
more,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
pride	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
country	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

On	O
the	O

there	B-ARG

My	O
view	O

that	O
the	O
government	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
priorities	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
invest	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG

Art	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
key	I-ARG

education	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
off,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
urgent	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
governments	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
commit	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
fundamental	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
setting	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

all	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG

This	O
is	O
simply	O
because	O
knowledge	B-ARG

wisdom	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
guarantee	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

social	I-ARG
system	I-ARG

Admittedly,	O
art,	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
extent,	I-ARG
serve	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
function	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
enriching	I-ARG
one's	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG

it	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
work	I-ARG

However,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
unrealistic	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pursuit	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
standard	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
developing	I-ARG
countries,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG
housing	I-ARG
supply	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG

By	B-ARG
comparison	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
issues,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
pursuit	I-ARG

seems	I-ARG
unimportant	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
all	I-ARG

To	O
conclude,	O

in	I-ARG
improving	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

I	O
think	O
that	O

other	I-ARG
social	I-ARG

This	O

because	O

in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

If	B-ARG

their	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG

would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
risk	I-ARG

As	O
a	O
result,	O
such	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
fail	I-ARG

cured	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
thus	I-ARG
influencing	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

which	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
destabilize	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

Also,	O
without	B-ARG
sufficient	I-ARG
guidance	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
the	B-ARG

Currently,	O
a	O

From	O
my	O
perspective,	O
I	O
think	O
flourishing	B-ARG
economies	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
hand	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
hand	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
preservation	I-ARG

Admittedly,	O
some	B-ARG
countries	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
developments	I-ARG
ahead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
protection,	I-ARG
thus	I-ARG
ruining	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG

As	O
these	B-ARG

countries	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
adequate	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
resources,	I-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
technologies	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
experience,	I-ARG
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
rely	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
maintain	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
standards	I-ARG
.	O
Besides,	O
people	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
poverty-stricken	I-ARG

are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

As	O
a	O

unchecked	B-ARG

uses	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
raw	I-ARG

which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
strain	I-ARG

In	O
this	O
view,	O
the	B-ARG
economic	I-ARG
development	I-ARG

environmental	I-ARG
protection	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
conflicting	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
I	O
believe	O
the	B-ARG
booming	I-ARG
economy	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
closely	I-ARG
linked	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
preservation	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

With	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
raising	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
green	I-ARG
economy,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
pollutants	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
increasingly	I-ARG
prevalent	I-ARG
among	I-ARG
clients,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
eco-friendly	I-ARG
businesses	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
favorable	I-ARG
impression	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
customers	I-ARG

For	O

electronic	B-ARG
bicycles	I-ARG
powered	I-ARG

clean	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
recent	I-ARG

.	O
Furthermore,	O
taking	B-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
consequences	I-ARG
seriously	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
enhance	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
efficiencies	I-ARG

If	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
firm	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
environmentally	I-ARG
conscious,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG

use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
production	I-ARG
lines	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
equipment,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
boost	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
it	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
spur	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
without	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
requirement	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
preservation,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
firm	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
consume	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
vast	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

constitutes	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

argue	O
that	O
keeping	B-ARG

wrong	I-ARG
because	O
animals	B-ARG
should	I-ARG

considered	I-ARG
non-human	I-ARG

they	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
right	I-ARG

freedom	I-ARG

This	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
unfair	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
kept	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
enclosures	I-ARG

That	O
is	O
because,	O
many	B-ARG
zoos,	I-ARG
especially	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ones	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
developing	I-ARG
countries,	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
care	I-ARG

their	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
Europe	I-ARG

On	O
the	O

Many	B-ARG

enjoy	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
zoos	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
favorite	I-ARG
animals,	I-ARG
cute	I-ARG
baby-born	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
corners	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
Zoos	B-ARG
provide	I-ARG
educational	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
public	I-ARG

Also,	O
zoos	B-ARG
play	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
reserving	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
breeds	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
animal	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
preventing	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
missing	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that,	O
in	B-ARG
zoos,	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
kept	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
enclosures	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
simulate	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
habitats	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
endangered	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
protected	I-ARG

zoos	B-ARG

nature	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
both	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
arguments	I-ARG
have	I-ARG

in	O
my	O

view,	O
more	B-ARG
good	I-ARG
come	I-ARG
from	I-ARG

However,	O
it	O

if	B-ARG

that	O
when	B-ARG

given	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG

most	I-ARG

out	I-ARG

any	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
nation	I-ARG

Today,	B-ARG
many	I-ARG

Arts	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
that	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
criticise	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
particular	I-ARG
country	I-ARG

To	O
illustrate	O
this	O
further,	O
the	B-ARG
famous	I-ARG
movie	I-ARG
'3	I-ARG
Idiots'	I-ARG
acted	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
Amir	I-ARG
Khan	I-ARG
criticises	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
chiefly	I-ARG
based	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
memorising	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
apply	I-ARG
whatever	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG

Thus,	O
human	B-ARG
rights	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
violated	I-ARG
if	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
allowed	I-ARG

Looking	O

there	O
are	O
certain	O
drawbacks	O
if	O
artists	O
are	O
not	O

They	B-ARG
might	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
deeper	I-ARG

certain	I-ARG
aspects	I-ARG
that	I-ARG

cause	I-ARG
controversies	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
country	I-ARG

cite	O
an	O

Malaysia	B-ARG

end	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
chaos	I-ARG
among	I-ARG

Nonetheless,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
artists	B-ARG
know	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
boundaries	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
well	I-ARG

would	I-ARG
surely	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
names	I-ARG
tarnished	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
unscrupulous	I-ARG
acts	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
it	O
is	O
now	O
evident	O
that	O
there	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
restrictions	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
artists'	I-ARG
work	I-ARG

Allowing	B-ARG
them	I-ARG

freely	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
as	O
ideas	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
naturally	I-ARG
flow	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
there	I-ARG

Hence,	O
even	B-ARG
though	I-ARG
freedom	I-ARG

bring	I-ARG
some	I-ARG

Nevertheless,	O
I	O

when	B-ARG

With	B-ARG
the	I-ARG

do	I-ARG

how	I-ARG
they	I-ARG

prepare	I-ARG

for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
.	O
Not	O
only	O
that,	O
the	B-ARG
mobile	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
used	I-ARG

In	O

if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG

those	I-ARG

an	I-ARG

Nonetheless,	O
looking	O
from	O
another	O
perspective,	O
supplying	B-ARG
hand	I-ARG
phones	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
waste	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

This	O
is	O
because	O
the	B-ARG
money	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
supply	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
electronic	I-ARG

purposes	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
country	I-ARG

To	O
illustrate	O
this	O
further,	O
the	B-ARG
money	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
amenities	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

To	O
conclude,	O
the	B-ARG
money	I-ARG

rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
giving	I-ARG

Furthermore,	O
when	B-ARG

take	I-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
this	I-ARG

It	B-ARG

that	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

Some	B-ARG
might	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
extent	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
lying	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG

In	O

the	B-ARG

a	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

I	O

the	O

I	O

Use	O

CCTV	O

Today,	O
close	O

are	O
widely	O
used	O
in	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O

They	O
are	O
used	O
in	O

some	O

premises	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
monitor	O
the	O
activities	O

It	O
is	O
undeniable	O
that	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
CCTV	O
has	O
plenty	O
of	O
benefits	O
to	O
offer,	O
especially	O
in	O
reducing	O
crimes	O
and	O
protecting	O
the	O
employees	O
in	O
a	O
premise	O
.	O
Nevertheless,	O
some	O
argue	O
that	O
these	O
cameras	O
invade	O
their	O
privacies	O
due	O
to	O
constantly	O
being	O
monitored	O
.	O
Even	O
so,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
CCTV	B-ARG
cameras	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
installed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
premise	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
combat	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ever	I-ARG
increasing	I-ARG
theft	I-ARG
rate	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
protect	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
workers	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
workplace	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
by	B-ARG
having	I-ARG
CCTV	I-ARG
cameras	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
workplace,	I-ARG
crimes	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
robbery	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
trimmed	I-ARG
down	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
because	O
when	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
shop	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
attacked	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
thieves,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
clips	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
cameras	I-ARG
serve	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
source	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
evidence	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
thieves	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
traced	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
illustrate	O
this	O
further,	O
in	B-ARG
Malaysia,	I-ARG
policemen	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
videos	I-ARG
captured	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
CCTV	I-ARG
cameras	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
trace	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
successfully	I-ARG
catch	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
robbers	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
broke	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
Seven	I-ARG
Eleven	I-ARG
shop	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
midnight	I-ARG
.	O
Not	O
only	O
that,	O
as	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
under	I-ARG
constant	I-ARG
surveillance,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
steal	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
shops	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
CCTVs	B-ARG
must	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
workplace	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
rates	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
minimized	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
at	B-ARG
some	I-ARG
offices,	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
required	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
handle	I-ARG
angry	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
frustrated	I-ARG
customers	I-ARG
.	O
At	O
times,	O
face-to-face	B-ARG
interactions	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
annoyed	I-ARG
customer	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
employee	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
danger	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
the	B-ARG
installation	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
CCTV	I-ARG
cameras	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
escape	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
situation	I-ARG
because	O
the	B-ARG
customers	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
conversations	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
recorded	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
the	O
event	O
of	O
an	O
argument,	O
the	B-ARG
videotapes	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
determine	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
actually	I-ARG
took	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
further	I-ARG
actions	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
short,	O
these	B-ARG
cameras	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
form	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
protection	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
workers	I-ARG
against	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
customers	I-ARG
.	O
Looking	O
from	O
another	O
perspective,	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
CCTV	O
cameras	O
does	O
cause	O
controversy	O
.	O
Those	B-ARG
opposing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
CCTV	I-ARG
systems	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
privacies	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
invaded	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
constant	I-ARG
monitoring	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cameras	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
one	B-ARG
must	I-ARG
realize	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
safety	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
paramount	I-ARG
importance	I-ARG
compared	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
privacy	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
prevention	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
suffering	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
consequences	I-ARG
.	O
Ergo,	O
opponents	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
comprehend	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
situation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
actions	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
victims	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
CCTV	B-ARG
cameras	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
therefore	I-ARG
must	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
installed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
premise	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
chiefly	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
shield	I-ARG
oneself	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
harmed	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
intruders	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
robbers	I-ARG

Admittedly,	O
privacies	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
lost	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
cameras	I-ARG
.	O
Nonetheless,	O
safety	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
put	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

constantly,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

up,	O
I	O

Some	O
people	O
think	O
that	O
human	O
needs	O
for	O
farmland,	O
housing	O
and	O
industry	O
are	O
more	O
Nowadays	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
issues	O
which	O
many	O
countries	O
and	O
nations	O
are	O
concern	O
about	O
that	O
.	O
Two	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
rate	O
of	O
increasing	O
population	O
and	O
endangered	O
plants	O
and	O
animals	O
.	O
From	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
although	O
endangered	B-ARG
animals	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
important,	I-ARG
human	B-ARG
needs	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
considered	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
day	B-ARG
by	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
population	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
increasing,	I-ARG
so	O
human	B-ARG
needs	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
increasing	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
.	O
We	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
farmland	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
grow	I-ARG
crops	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
wheat	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
corn,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
doubt	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
alive	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
weeks	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
farmlands	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
vital	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
people	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
shelters	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
protect	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
mother	I-ARG
nature	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
wind	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
flood	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
wild	I-ARG
animals,	I-ARG
so	O
they	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
land	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
houses	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
Dwelling	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
undeniable	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
human	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
crucial	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
continue	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
industrial	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
medicine	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
some	B-ARG
lands	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
assigned	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
.	O
Todays	B-ARG
life	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
difficulty	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
comfortable	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
the	B-ARG
population	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
endangered	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
population,	I-ARG
so	O
they	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
land	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
would	O
maintain	O
that	O
nowadays	B-ARG
humans	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
farmland,	I-ARG
housing	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
because	O
of	O
increasing	B-ARG
population	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
saving	I-ARG
land	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
endangered	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
totally	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
decision	I-ARG

In	O
addition,	O
because	O
the	B-ARG
cost	I-ARG

higher	I-ARG

that	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O

However,	O
reasonable	B-ARG

It	B-ARG

about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
because,	O
knowing	B-ARG
their	I-ARG
background	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
enable	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
juries	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
analyze	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
coming	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
judgment	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
take	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
murdered	I-ARG
anyone	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
suddenly	I-ARG
found	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
guilty	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
juries	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
weather	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
individual	I-ARG
committed	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
intentionally	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
circumstances	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
knowing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
facts	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
.	O
Then,	O
punishment	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
given	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
accordance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
condition	I-ARG
.	O
Apart	O
from	O
that,	O
a	B-ARG
fair	I-ARG
trial	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
achieved	I-ARG

As	O
all	O

us	O

juries	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
regarding	I-ARG
law	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
exposing	B-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
past	I-ARG
records	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
room	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
rationally	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
finally	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
pieces	I-ARG

produce	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

By	O
doing	O
so,	O
the	B-ARG
juries	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sense	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
relief	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
come	I-ARG

that,	O
the	B-ARG
convicted	I-ARG
will	I-ARG

receive	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
fair	I-ARG
action	I-ARG

It	O
is	O
undeniable	O
that	O
when	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
background	I-ARG

anonymous	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
his	I-ARG

If	B-ARG

he	I-ARG

he	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

However,	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
crimes	I-ARG

that	I-ARG

Beyond	B-ARG
that	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
proportion	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
elevated	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
multitude	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

life	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
an	I-ARG

take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

whatever	I-ARG

the	B-ARG
academic	I-ARG

the	B-ARG
expertise	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
senior	I-ARG
workers	I-ARG

Hence,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG

I	O

the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

effective	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
medical	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
developing	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
incapable	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
producing	I-ARG
high-quality	I-ARG
drugs	I-ARG

With	B-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
technology,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
developed	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
achieved	I-ARG
remarkable	I-ARG
breakthroughs	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
making	I-ARG

cure	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
variety	I-ARG

If	B-ARG
people	I-ARG

these	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
better	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
reduction	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
cost	I-ARG

medicines	I-ARG
therefore	I-ARG
shows	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
sign	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
humanity	I-ARG

However,	O
the	B-ARG
current	I-ARG
cost	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
medicines	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
fact,	I-ARG
reasonable	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
based	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

Apparently,	O
the	B-ARG
process	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
researching,	I-ARG
testing	I-ARG

producing	I-ARG
drugs	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
masses	I-ARG
costs	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
substantial	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
these	B-ARG
products	I-ARG
prove	I-ARG

human	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
completely	I-ARG

Suppose	B-ARG
companies	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
forced	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cost	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
drugs,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
profit,	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
running	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
debt	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
production	I-ARG
expenditure	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
the	B-ARG
measure	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
adopted,	I-ARG
otherwise	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
liquidation	I-ARG

In	O

this	O

not	O
a	O
long-term	O
solution	O

Fortunately,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
measures	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
situation	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
advisable	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
medical	I-ARG
production	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
supplying	I-ARG
land	I-ARG

building	I-ARG
factories	I-ARG

reducing	I-ARG
part	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
taxes	I-ARG

Additionally,	O
charitable	B-ARG
organizations	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
buy	I-ARG
medicines	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	B-ARG
disagree	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
reducing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cost	I-ARG

The	O
awareness	O

has	O
put	O
much	O
pressure	O
on	O
the	O
government	O
and	O
private	O
sectors	O

As	O
a	O
result,	O
some	O

prohibit	O
smoking	O
in	O
their	O
premises	O
and	O
even	O
some	O
governments	O
restrict	O
smoking	O
in	O
public	O
area	O

It	O
is	O
agreed	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
move	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
looking	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
image	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
nation	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
run	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
known	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
clinically	I-ARG
proven	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
extremely	I-ARG
hazardous	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
smoker	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
exposed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fume	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
period	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
Recent	B-ARG
death	I-ARG
statistic	I-ARG
released	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Malaysian	I-ARG
Ministry	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
Health	I-ARG
shows	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
top	I-ARG
killer	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
lung	I-ARG
related	I-ARG
diseases	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
.	O
A	B-ARG
large	I-ARG
proportion	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
death	I-ARG
involved	I-ARG
second	I-ARG
hand	I-ARG
smoker	I-ARG
particularly	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
pregnant	I-ARG
women	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
vulnerable	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
lethal	I-ARG
diseases	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
the	B-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
fatality	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
significantly	I-ARG
reduced	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
total	I-ARG
ban	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
implemented	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
the	B-ARG
image	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
nation	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
promoted	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
restricts	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
imposing	I-ARG
stern	I-ARG
penalty	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
offender	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
the	B-ARG
Brunei	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
recently	I-ARG
enforced	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
law	I-ARG
against	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
cafés,	I-ARG
hospital	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
shopping	I-ARG
street	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
step	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
curbed	I-ARG
down	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
numbers	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
smokers	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
result,	I-ARG
Brunei	I-ARG
remains	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
known	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
tranquility	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
cleanliness	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
example	I-ARG
shows	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
restricting	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
the	B-ARG
effort	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prohibit	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
area	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
certainly	I-ARG
helping	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
curtailing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
associated	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
risks	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

It	O

various	O
reasons	O

Firstly,	O
rapid	B-ARG
development	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
eating	I-ARG
most	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
so-called	I-ARG

produced	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
trees	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
converting	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
wild	B-ARG
life	I-ARG

essential	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
maintain	I-ARG
ecological	I-ARG
balance	I-ARG
on	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
large	B-ARG
emissions	I-ARG

carbon	I-ARG

gas	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
refrigerants	I-ARG
like	I-ARG

Importance	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
ozone	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
evident	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fact	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
protects	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
from	I-ARG

To	O
add	O
to	O
it,	O
excess	B-ARG

mainly	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
vehicles	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Lastly,	O
either	B-ARG
industrial	I-ARG

an	B-ARG

the	O

In	O

the	B-ARG

another	B-ARG

that	O

Taxes	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
income	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG

they	I-ARG

If	B-ARG

many	I-ARG

things	I-ARG

In	O
fact,	O
in	B-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
country,	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG

In	O
this	O

the	B-ARG
crime	I-ARG

Furthermore,	O
being	B-ARG
a	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Taking	O
everything	O
into	O
account,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
being	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
citizen	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
number	I-ARG

duties,	I-ARG

than	I-ARG
paying	I-ARG
taxes	I-ARG

Testing	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
most	O
serious	O
problem	O
facing	O
the	O
animals'	O
rights	O
today	O

animal	O
experimentation	O

Many	O

by	O
animal	O

While	O
most	O
scientists	O
claim	O
that	O
this	O

vital	O
for	O

human	O
health,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
primates	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
rights	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
beings	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
reasons	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
animal	I-ARG
testing	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
banned	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
the	B-ARG
costs	I-ARG
outweigh	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG
.	O
Every	B-ARG
year,	I-ARG
cosmetic	I-ARG
companies,	I-ARG
farms	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
medical	I-ARG
schools	I-ARG
kill	I-ARG
millions	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
test	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
products,	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
beneficial	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
.	O
Animal	B-ARG
testing	I-ARG
costs	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
enormous	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money,	I-ARG
since	O
they	B-ARG
must	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
fed,	I-ARG
cared	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
treated	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
drugs	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
experimental	I-ARG
substances	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
animals	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
kept	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
unnatural	I-ARG
conditions	I-ARG
.	O
Recent	B-ARG
studies	I-ARG
point	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
neglected	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
treated	I-ARG
poorly,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
influences	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
reactions	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
drugs	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
March	I-ARG
2003,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lab	I-ARG
technician	I-ARG
shot	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
video	I-ARG
inside	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lab,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
revealed	I-ARG
primates	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
cages	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
pain	I-ARG
medication,	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
instance	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
baboon	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
metal	I-ARG
cylinder	I-ARG
screwed	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
head	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
sacrificing	B-ARG
animals	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
expensive	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
painful	I-ARG
activity	I-ARG
.	O
There	O
is	O
also	O
the	O
argument	O
that	O
many	O
ethical	O
and	O
genetic	O
principles	O
are	O
broken	O
when	O
testing	O
on	O
animals	O
.	O
Many	O
people	O
agree	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
inhumane	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
cruel	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
pain	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
animals,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
misleading,	I-ARG
since	O
animals	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
response	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
drug	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
personally	O
believe	O
that	O
human	B-ARG
beings	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
moral	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
individual	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
the	O
reasons	O
mentioned	O
above,	O
it	B-ARG
seems	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
testing	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
clear	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
and	O
consequently,	O
it	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
illegal	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
richer	I-ARG
nations	I-ARG
.	O
High	B-ARG
population	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
poorer	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
planning	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
proportion	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
doctors	I-ARG
unbalance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
quantity	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

On	O
top	O
of	O
that,	O
poorer	B-ARG
nations	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
hospitals	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
fulfill	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
demand	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
patients	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
solve	O
these	O
issues,	O
richer	B-ARG
nations	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
contribute	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
delegating	I-ARG
doctors	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
nurses	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
power	I-ARG
nations	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
donate	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
hospitals	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
in	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
area	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
education,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
generally	I-ARG
agreed	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
poorer	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
schools	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
lecturers	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
institutions	I-ARG
.	O
Besides	O
that,	O
education	B-ARG
for	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
normally	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
afford	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
order	O
to	O
solve	O
the	O
education	O
manpower	O
problem,	O
richer	B-ARG
countries	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
allocate	I-ARG
experienced	I-ARG
educators	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
train	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
lecturers	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
poorer	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
.	O
Meanwhile,	O
for	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
issue	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
fee,	I-ARG
richer	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
offer	I-ARG
scholarships	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
loan	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
qualified	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
Lastly,	O
in	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
area	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
trade,	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
deny	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
poorer	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
lagging	I-ARG
behind	I-ARG
richer	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
shortage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
Trading	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
active	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
poorer	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
incomplete	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
infrastructure	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
residents	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
rural	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
depend	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
farm	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
production	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
token	O
of	O
goodwill,	O
richer	B-ARG
nations	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
service	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
poorer	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
trading	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
former	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
consultation	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
setting	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
complete	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
efficient	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
infrastructure	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
support	I-ARG
trading	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
richer	B-ARG
nations	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
helping	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
poorer	I-ARG
nations	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
health,	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
trade	I-ARG
.	O
Improvements	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
residents	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
poorer	I-ARG
nations	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
use	I-ARG

grow	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

There	O
will	O
be	O
soon	O
no	O
role	O
for	O

in	O

In	O
recent	O

it	O

more	O
common	O
for	O

to	O
use	O
technological	O
tools	O
in	O
the	O
learning	O
process	O
.	O
However,	O
I	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
agree	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
explosion	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
'innovate'	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
system,	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
replacing	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
computers	I-ARG
.	O
There	O
are	O
several	O
reasons	O
why	O
teachers	O
will	O
never	O
be	O
replaced	O
by	O
computers	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
computers	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
operated	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
No	B-ARG
one	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
argue	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
technological	I-ARG
tools	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
must-haves	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
today	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
lessons	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
attractive	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
Power	I-ARG
Point	I-ARG
presentation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
presented	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
LCD	I-ARG
Projector	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
scientists	B-ARG
prove	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
trained	I-ARG
staff	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
interactive	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
innovative	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
teaching	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
nowadays	O
the	O
learning	O
process	O
benefits	O
greatly	O
from	O
computers,	O
but	O
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
tools	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
properly	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
human's	I-ARG
touch	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
children	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
interactions	I-ARG
.	O
No	B-ARG
matter	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
clear	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
computer	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
communicate	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
pupils	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
recent	O
interview	O
with	O
Josh	O
Trumm	O
–	O
the	O
founder	O
of	O
the	O
'Teachers	O
Global	O
Group'-	O
reveals,	O
human	O
interactions	O
will	O
never	O
be	O
imitated	O
by	O
computers:	O
'This	O
verbal	O
and	O
non-verbal	O

between	O

the	O
first	O

towards	O
a	O
proper	O
education	O
.	O
Without	B-ARG
someone	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
explain	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
problems,	I-ARG
pupils	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
actually	I-ARG
learn'	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
am	O
inclined	O
to	O
agree	O
with	O
this	O
scientific	O
view,	O
because	O
only	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
connect	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
pupils,	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
model	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
there	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
computers	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
continue	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
process,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
.	O
Teachers	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
teachers,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
also	I-ARG

In	O

the	O

a	O
controversy	O

While	O

that	O

the	O

that	O
this	O

a	O

of	O
negative	O
effects	O
to	O
people's	O
health	O

and	O
the	O
society	O
.	O
Admittedly,	O
applying	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
fertilizers	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
combine	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
automatic	I-ARG
reaping	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
farmers'	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
profit	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
because	O
artificial	B-ARG
fertilizers	I-ARG
catalyze	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
capacity	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
inch	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
farmland	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
churn	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
crops,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
automatic	I-ARG
machinery	I-ARG
enhances	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
efficiency	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
harvest	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
the	B-ARG
production	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
labour	I-ARG
cost	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
kilogram	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
agriculture	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
dramatically	I-ARG
decreased	I-ARG

However,	O
high-tech	B-ARG
fertilizers	I-ARG
pose	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
threat	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
individuals'	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
well-being	I-ARG
.	O
Unlike	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
organic	I-ARG
plant	I-ARG
foods,	I-ARG
industrialized	I-ARG
fertilizers	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
unusual	I-ARG
chemicals,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
varying	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
gene	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

into	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
unknown	I-ARG
substances	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
remaining	I-ARG
inside	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

permanently	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
this	O
case,	O
consumers	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
intake	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
fertilized	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
excessively	B-ARG
relying	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
electronic	I-ARG

causes	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
impacts	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

One	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
worsens	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

In	O
contrast,	O

For	O
another,	O

of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

a	O
suggestion	O
that	O

should	O
not	O

the	O

they	O

In	O
my	O
view,	O
I	O
firmly	O
disagree	O
with	O
this	O
recommendation	O
due	O
to	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
The	O
main	O
reason	O
why	O
I	O
believe	O
artists	O
should	O
be	O
funded	O
is	O
because	O
art	B-ARG
helps	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
attracting	I-ARG
tourists	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
monuments	B-ARG
that	I-ARG
represent	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
illustrate	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
city's	I-ARG
history	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
culture,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
beautiful	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
attractive	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
tourists	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
some	B-ARG
countries	I-ARG
depend	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
source	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
revenue,	I-ARG
thus,	O
the	B-ARG
governments	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
arts	I-ARG
because	O
their	B-ARG
work	I-ARG
crafts	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
boost	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tourist	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
sculptures	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
paintings	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
museums	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
galleries	I-ARG
generally	I-ARG
reflect	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
civilization	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
generation	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
culture	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
history	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
reserved	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
assured	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
.	O
Young	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
country's	I-ARG
history	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
observing	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
crafts	I-ARG
.	O
Another	O
reason	O
why	O
artists	O
should	O
be	O
helped	O
is	O
because	O
talent	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
extremely	I-ARG
precious	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
wasted	I-ARG
.	O
Indeed,	O
not	B-ARG
many	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
blessed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
talent	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
paintings	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
crafts	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
this	B-ARG
type	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
talent	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
valued	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
types	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
talents	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
talent	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
science	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
literature	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
art	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
object	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
talent	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
area	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
discovered	I-ARG
everywhere,	I-ARG
so	O
I	O
think	O

For	O

the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
amazing	I-ARG
performances	I-ARG
they	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

are	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
aesthetic	I-ARG

While	B-ARG

a	I-ARG

their	B-ARG

those	I-ARG

necessary	I-ARG

Hence,	O
their	B-ARG
privilege	I-ARG

groundless,	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

Capital	O

Capital	O
punishment	O
is	O
a	O
controversial	O
debate	O
in	O
many	O
countries	O

In	O
a	O
world	O
where	O

it	O
may	O
be	O

the	O
death	O

an	O

However,	O
as	O
the	O
society	O
grows,	O
human	O
rights	O
become	O
more	O
highly	O
respected,	O
"murdering"	B-ARG
criminals	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
therefore	I-ARG
immoral	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
accept	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
it	O
is	O
recognized	O
that	O
every	B-ARG
human	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
authority	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
empowered	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
deprive	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Although	O
what	B-ARG
criminals	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society,	I-ARG
specifically	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
victims,	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
indeed	I-ARG
significantly	I-ARG
offensive,	I-ARG
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
humans	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
valued	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
execution	B-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
resolve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
consequences	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
crime,	I-ARG
not	O
to	O
mention	O
it	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
criminal's	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
hardship	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
pain	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
victim's	I-ARG
kin	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
consoled	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
capital	B-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
certainly	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
option	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
control	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
crimes,	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
imprisonment	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
effective	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
detaining	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
criminals	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
prison	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rest	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
in	B-ARG
terms	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
punishment,	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
miserable	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
restriction	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
outside	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
sustaining	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
feeling	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
guilt	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
dark	I-ARG
bounded	I-ARG
room	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
obsessing	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
killed	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
third	I-ARG
reason	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
death	I-ARG
penalty	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
banned	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
innocent	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
wrongly	I-ARG
convicted	I-ARG
.	O
Juries	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
humans,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
discretion	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
many	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
executed	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
commit,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
question	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
fairness	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
judicial	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
although	O
capital	B-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
presents	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
extreme	I-ARG
warning	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
community,	I-ARG
I	O
firmly	O
object	O
to	O
it	O
because	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
absurd	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
inhumane	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
it	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG

Businesses	O
should	O
be	O
only	O

about	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
companies,	O

establish	O
to	O

products	O
which	O
are	O
people's	O

make	O
a	O

for	O
their	O

However,	O
I	B-ARG
completely	I-ARG
disagree	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
businesses	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
allowed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
anything	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
profit	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
permission	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
allowed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
hit	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
damage	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
making	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
profit	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
if	B-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
control	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
businesses	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
permitted	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
want,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
threaten	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
beings'	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
human,	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
plants	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
every	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
read	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
hear	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
televisions	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
newspapers	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
factories	I-ARG
hit	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
toxic	I-ARG
substances	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
if	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
let	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
anything	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
profit,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
produce	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
low	I-ARG
qualities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
prices,	I-ARG
therefore	O
they	B-ARG
might	I-ARG
hit	I-ARG
consumer's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
a	B-ARG
few	I-ARG
months	I-ARG
ago	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
broadcast	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
produced	I-ARG
baby	I-ARG
milk,	I-ARG
sold	I-ARG
milk	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
few	I-ARG
babies	I-ARG
die	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
all	B-ARG
companies,	I-ARG
factories	I-ARG

businesses	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
monitored	I-ARG
by	I-ARG

anything	I-ARG

want	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
due	I-ARG

pretty	I-ARG
old	I-ARG

I	O

Firstly,	O
I	O

Their	B-ARG
old	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
pretty	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

materials,	I-ARG
repairing	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Also	O
the	B-ARG
laboratory	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
physics	I-ARG

was	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG

so	O
the	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
can't	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
well	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
study	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
the	B-ARG

a	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
communities	I-ARG

districts	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
.	O
After	B-ARG
classes	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
building	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

school,	I-ARG
participate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
different	I-ARG

For	O

during	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
football	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG

after	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
competition	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG

This	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
connections	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
only	I-ARG
disadvantage	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
noisiness	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bit	I-ARG

but	O
I	O
think	O
this	B-ARG
isn't	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

ceasing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

To	O
sum	O
up,	O
this	B-ARG
new	I-ARG
construction	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

like	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
connections	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
communities,	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
new	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
only	I-ARG
disadvantage	I-ARG

that	O
teenaged	O
children	O

in	O
age	O
of	O
15	O

18	O

fully	O

so	O
they	O

not	O

any	O
help	O
for	O

However,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
teenagers	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
comparison	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
ages	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
will	O
discuss	O
my	O
view	O
in	O
two	O
main	O
areas	O
.	O
In	O
the	O
first	O
place,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
parents	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
relatives	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
experienced	I-ARG
towards	I-ARG
children,	I-ARG
therefore	O
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
advisor	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
experienced	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
numbers	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
stuffs	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
so	O
if	B-ARG
children	I-ARG
listen	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
advices	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
happening	I-ARG
worst	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
save	I-ARG
value	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
money,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
believed	O
that	O
parents	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
relatives	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
consular	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
teenagers,	I-ARG
because	O
unfortunately	B-ARG
nowadays	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
individuals	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
cheat	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
gaining	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
power	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
cheat	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
ages	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
believe	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
immature	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
trap	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
it	O
makes	O
no	O
difference,	O
people	O
from	O
young	O
ages	O
to	O
old	O
ages	O
are	O
free	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
decision,	O
nonetheless	O
sometimes	O
to	O
prevent	O
some	O
problems	O
coming	O
up	O
for	O
young	O
individuals	O
,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
ask	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
relatives	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
piece	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
advice	I-ARG
.	O

Children	O
are	O
free	O
You	O
hardly	O
ever	O
can	O
find	O
a	O
person	O
who	O
says	O
that	O
he	O
or	O
she	O
had	O
unpleasant	O
childhood	O
.	O
When	O
individuals	O
reminisce	O
their	O
memories	O
they	O
absolutely	O
infer	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
childhood	O
events	O
.	O
As	O
much	O
as	O
their	O
events	O
might	O
were	O
bitter,	O
in	O
their	O
adulthood	O
they	O
are	O
sweet	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
childhood	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
definitely	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
happiest	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
two	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
the	O
first	O
place,	O
children	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
whatever	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
restricted	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
limitation	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
rare	I-ARG
.	O
Because	O
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
growth	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
allowed	I-ARG
whatever	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
stuffs	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore	O
there	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
argument	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
in	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
expected	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
responsible	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
they	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
educate	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work,	I-ARG
so	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
hand	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
this	I-ARG

their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG

As	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact,	O
I	B-ARG
made	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
number	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
age,	I-ARG

I	I-ARG
almost	I-ARG
traveled	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
county	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
kindergarten	I-ARG

Also	O
I	B-ARG
got	I-ARG
familiar	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
plants	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
age	I-ARG

All	O
in	O
all,	O
I	O
would	O
maintain	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
best	I-ARG
phase	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
childhood	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
whatever	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
confine	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
punishment,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
hands	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O

Concentrate	O
on	O
the	O
objectives	O
-	O
people	O
attend	O
schools	O
for	O
various	O
reasons	O
From	O
many	O
centuries	O
ago,	O
universities	O
have	O
been	O
playing	O
an	O
important	O
role	O
in	O
ones'	O
life	O
.	O
Different	O
people	O
attend	O
university	O
for	O
different	O
point	O
of	O
views	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
perspective,	O
the	B-ARG
three	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
reasons	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
increased	I-ARG
knowledge,	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
preparation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
for	B-ARG
most	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
ideal	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
understanding	I-ARG
.	O
Truthfully,	O
in	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
wonderful	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
environment,	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
provided	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
varieties	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
gigantic	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
well-trained	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
people	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
strengthen	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
through	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
instructions	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
teachers,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
sufficient	I-ARG
infrastructure	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
laboratory,	I-ARG
library,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
capable	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
aspect	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
gain	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
deep	I-ARG
sight	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
studying	O
in	O
university	O
means	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
totally	O
turned	O
into	O
a	O
different	O
page	O
of	O
your	O
life,	O
which	O
included	O
many	O
new	O
experiences	O
.	O
The	B-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
individual	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
enroll	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
enormous,	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
studied	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
students	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
given	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
fantastic	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
wide	I-ARG
relationships	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
corner	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
nation,	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
my	B-ARG
brother	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
mixed	I-ARG
community	I-ARG
include	I-ARG
Vietnam,	I-ARG
Brazil,	I-ARG
Argentina,	I-ARG
etc	I-ARG
.	O
And	B-ARG
he	I-ARG
told	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
excited	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
experiencing	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
environment,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
purposes	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
attending	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
preparing	B-ARG
for	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
function	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
.	O
Students	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
homework,	I-ARG
assignment	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
participate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
volunteer	I-ARG
work,	I-ARG
internship	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
outside	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
discover	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
goals	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
.	O
After	O
all,	O
they	B-ARG
know	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
emphasis	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
objectives	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
summation,	O
people	O
may	O
attend	O
university	O
for	O
various	O
reasons	O
.	O
Some	O
want	O
to	O
enjoy	O
new	O

some	O

their	O

Even	O
though	O
the	O
purposes	O
could	O
be	O
various,	O
everybody	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
concentrate	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
objectives	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
.	O

People	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
focus	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
making	I-ARG
wealth	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
progress	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
The	O
life	O
today	O
is	O
totally	O
different	O
from	O
half	O
centuries	O
before	O

Advances	O
in	O
technology	O
do	O
help	O
humans	O
to	O
solve	O
abundant	O
of	O
problems;	O
however	O
it	O
also	O
deprives	O
of	O
some	O
things	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
life	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
days	I-ARG
brings	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
happiness	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
today	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
reasons	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
first	O
reason	O
is	O
life	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
simple	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
past	I-ARG
.	O
Nowadays,	B-ARG
all	I-ARG
humans	I-ARG
compete	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
.	O
Since	O
world	B-ARG
population	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
higher,	I-ARG
competition	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
fierce	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
handle	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
jobs,	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
replace	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
.	O
People	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
effort	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
condition	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
lives	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
days	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
today	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
the	B-ARG
environment	I-ARG
today	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
damaged	I-ARG
.	O
Looking	B-ARG
out	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
windows,	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
isn't	I-ARG
sky,	I-ARG
trees	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
mountains,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
coldly	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
buildings	I-ARG
.	O
Everyday,	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
walk	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
roads,	I-ARG
breath	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
polluted	I-ARG
air,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
limited	I-ARG
space	I-ARG
.	O
What's	O
worse,	O
it	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
proved	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
condition	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
mental	I-ARG
diseases	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
the	B-ARG
environment	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
grandparents	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
comfortable	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
today	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
third	I-ARG
reason	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
pace	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Today,	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
read	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
news	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
chat	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Internet,	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
travel	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
planes;	I-ARG
however,	O
it	B-ARG
also	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
happens	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
affect	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
react	I-ARG
properly	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
immediately,	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
vulnerable	I-ARG
situation	I-ARG
.	O
We	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
fast	I-ARG
pace	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
while	O
there	O
some	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
pretty	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
condition,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O
as	O
I	O

above	O
students	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
right	I-ARG

Not	B-ARG
allowing	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
desired	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG

chosen	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
restriction	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
rights	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
children	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
independent	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
rights	I-ARG

opportunities	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
goals	I-ARG

dreams	I-ARG

Next,	O
students	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
progress	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG

Also,	O
we	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
avoid	I-ARG
conflicts	I-ARG
among	I-ARG
students	I-ARG

teachers	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
enjoyable	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
productive	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
instructor	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
students	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
when	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
art	I-ARG

everyone	I-ARG
shared	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

Giving	B-ARG
chance	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
interested	I-ARG
fields	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
merit	I-ARG
.	O
Lastly,	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
reason	O
I	O
support	O
this	O
idea	O
is	O
he	B-ARG

an	I-ARG

she/he	I-ARG

an	I-ARG
aptitude	I-ARG

When	B-ARG
schools	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
best	I-ARG

succeed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
which	I-ARG

one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
point	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
education	I-ARG

Furthermore,	O
this	B-ARG
type	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
as	O
a	O
young	O

I	B-ARG

it	B-ARG

advantage	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
as	I-ARG

Having	O

Under	O

administration,	O
tourism	O
enhances	O
local	O
economic	O
development	O
Tourist	O
trade	O
is	O
becoming	O
a	O
powerful	O
engine	O
for	O
the	O
economy	O
.	O
Nevertheless,	O
some	O
individuals	O
believe	O
that	O
this	O
position	O
ignores	O
the	O
ecological	O

environmental	O
destruction,	O

a	O

While	O
both	O
positions	O
seem	O
reasonable,	O
my	O
view	O
is	O
that,	O
through	B-ARG
proper	I-ARG
management	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
regulation,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
booming	I-ARG
tourist	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
excellent	I-ARG
source	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
growth	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
wealth	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
rural	I-ARG

urban	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
most	I-ARG
obvious	I-ARG
merit	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
vastly	I-ARG
boost	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
particular	I-ARG
state	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
region	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
takes	I-ARG
place,	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
direct	I-ARG
expenditure	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
tourists,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
direct	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
indirect	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
community,	I-ARG
including	I-ARG
retail,	I-ARG
agriculture,	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
service	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
increasing	I-ARG
tax	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
expansion	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
markets	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
accommodation,	I-ARG
luxury	I-ARG
goods	I-ARG
amongst	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
solid,	I-ARG
well-regulated	I-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
tourism	B-ARG
provides	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
considerable	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
direct	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
indirect	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

hotels,	I-ARG
transport,	I-ARG
agriculture,	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
service	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
increase	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
opportunities	I-ARG
allows	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
significant	I-ARG
contribution	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
purchasing	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
commodities	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
growing	I-ARG
incomes	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
this	B-ARG
gives	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
cycle,	I-ARG
generating	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
prosperity	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
return	I-ARG
.	O
Some	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
oppose	I-ARG
these,	I-ARG
citing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
destruction	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
compared	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
industry,	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
alternatives,	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
resource	I-ARG
extraction	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
manufacture,	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
far	I-ARG
worse	I-ARG
destroyers	I-ARG

For	O

On	O
the	O

hand,	O
the	B-ARG
dramatic	I-ARG
majority	I-ARG

these	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

it	B-ARG

nine	I-ARG

that	O

Many	B-ARG

What	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
worse,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
pain	I-ARG

losing	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
members	I-ARG

It	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
those	B-ARG
people	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
support	I-ARG

Despite	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O

those	O

it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
reasonable	I-ARG

charity	B-ARG
organisations	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
home	I-ARG

there	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
demand	I-ARG

Another	O
reason	O

that,	O
even	B-ARG
within	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG

positive	I-ARG
waves	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
main	I-ARG
purpose	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
such	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG

share	I-ARG
emotions	I-ARG

These	B-ARG
emotions	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
shared	I-ARG
locally	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
village	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
city,	I-ARG
nationally	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
internationally	I-ARG
too	I-ARG

Obviously	O
these	B-ARG
events	I-ARG
gather	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
nationalist	I-ARG
pride	I-ARG
feeling	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
increased	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
the	B-ARG
football	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
cup	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
four	I-ARG
years	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
followed	I-ARG
event	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
fun	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
these	B-ARG
sports	I-ARG
events	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
issues	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
politics	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
affairs	I-ARG

Thus,	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
general	I-ARG
atmosphere	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
peaceful	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
fraternal,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
reality	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
different	I-ARG

In	O
other	O
words,	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
"calm	O
before	O
the	O
storm"	O
.	O
After	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
Olympics	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
finished,	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
came	I-ARG
back	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
normal	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
game	I-ARG
competition	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
forgotten	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
majority	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
picture	O
it,	O
recently,	B-ARG
Putin	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
pleased	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
open	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
last	I-ARG
winter	I-ARG
Olympic	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
gather	I-ARG

countries,	I-ARG

actually	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
just	I-ARG

Finally,	O
an	B-ARG
international	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

The	O

Sometimes,	B-ARG

complain	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
successfully,	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
fitting	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
found	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
uncle	I-ARG

He	B-ARG
once	I-ARG
complained	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
service	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
restaurant	I-ARG

Without	B-ARG
exaggeration,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
directly	I-ARG
went	I-ARG

told	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

Afterward,	B-ARG
my	I-ARG

face-to	I-ARG

communication	I-ARG

If	B-ARG
he	I-ARG
just	I-ARG

something	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
we	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
commence	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
agree	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
communicating	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
way	I-ARG

the	O
one	O
I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
above,	O
another	O
equally	O
crucible	O

is	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
deceived	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
face-to	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	B-ARG
had	I-ARG
received	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
harmful	I-ARG
words	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
facebook	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
friend,	I-ARG
Eric	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
said	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
totally	I-ARG
failed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
building	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
friendship	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
anymore	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
just	I-ARG
shocked	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
happened	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
I	B-ARG
realized	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
facebook	I-ARG
account	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
stolen	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
from	O
this	O
case,	O
we	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
capable	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
stating	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
talk	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
face-to-face	I-ARG

Admittedly,	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
some	O
dissidents	O
proclaiming	O
that	O
communication	B-ARG
by	I-ARG
letters,	I-ARG
email,	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
telephone	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
enable	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
talk	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
scruple,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
parts	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
from	O
my	O
limited	O
understanding,	O
I	O
just	O
doubt	O
the	O
credibility	O
of	O
that	O
saying	O
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
conceivable	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
talk,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
imprudent	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
words	I-ARG

Talking	B-ARG
without	I-ARG
scruple	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
indispensable	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
communication;	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
contrast,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
usually	I-ARG
detrimental	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
.	O
Based	O
on	O
the	O
reasons	O
demonstrated	O
above,	O
I	B-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
my	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

In	O

I	O
think	O
the	B-ARG

However,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
it	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
type	I-ARG

for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG

learners	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
focusing	B-ARG
only	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
talented	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
option	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
helps	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
institutions	I-ARG
maintain	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
.	O
Unlike	B-ARG
middle	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
school,	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
college	I-ARG
require	I-ARG
far	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
ability	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
enormous	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
complex	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
some	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
capable	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
schools,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
tough	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
talented	I-ARG
ones	I-ARG
.	O
That	B-ARG
explains	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
suitable	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
limited	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
opening	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
fatal	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
institutions,	I-ARG
since	O
they	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
somehow	I-ARG
lower	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
materials	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
practical	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
university	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
accept	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
gives	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
sophisticated	I-ARG
purposes	I-ARG
.	O
Some	O
people	O
argue	O
that	O
this	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
'social	I-ARG
division',	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
refuses	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
called	I-ARG
'low	I-ARG
jobs',	I-ARG
but	O
actually	O
it	B-ARG
gives	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
harm	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
community	I-ARG
.	O
Those	B-ARG
standard	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
everyone,	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
complex	I-ARG
ones	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
handled	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
start	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
institutions	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
think	O
limiting	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
admitted	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
universities	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG
since	O
it	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
reward	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
motivation	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
constantly	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG
level	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
learning,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
.	O
Ultimately,	O
this	B-ARG
improves	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
overall	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
gives	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
serve	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
sum	O
thing	O
up,	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
everyone	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
compulsory	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
level	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
school,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
above	I-ARG
divisions	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
realm	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
universities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
students,	I-ARG
thus	I-ARG
placing	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
positions	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
suit	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
most	I-ARG

Improving	O
facilities	O

the	O
best	O
way	O
There	O
is	O
a	O
hotly	O

issue	O
over	O
whether	O
universities	O

on	O
improving	O
facilities	O

more	O
than	O
hiring	O

this	O

from	O
several	O

I	O

the	O

that	O
is,	O
I	B-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
improving	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
first	O
and	O
foremost	O
reason	O
lies	O
in	O
an	O
inevitable	O
fact	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
more	I-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
have,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
chances	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
library	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
concentrate	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
tranquil	I-ARG
ambience;	I-ARG
also,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
references	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
utilize	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
convenient	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
versatile	I-ARG
facility,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
condition	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
we	O
can	O
commence	O
to	O
agree	O
that	O
certain	B-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
beneficial	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
another	O
equally	O
crucial	O
aspect	O
is	O
that	O
students	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
staying	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
classrooms	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
numerous	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
.	O
Consider	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
circumstance	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
member	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
jazz	I-ARG
ensemble	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
must	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
auditorium	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
extraordinary	I-ARG
performance	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
distinguished	I-ARG
performance,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
acquire	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
unforgettable	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
burring	I-ARG
deeply	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
his	I-ARG

Hence,	O
from	O
this	O
case,	O
we	O
are	O
capable	O
of	O

that	O
students	B-ARG

I	O
believe	O
that	O

prepare	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
specialization	I-ARG
at	I-ARG

In	O

it	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
some	I-ARG

prevent	I-ARG

from	I-ARG
avoiding	I-ARG
hurdles	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
begin	O
with,	O
students	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
fields	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
interested	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
should	I-ARG

without	I-ARG
trying	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
broad	I-ARG
range	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

otherwise	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
miss	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG

For	O

a	B-ARG
would-be	I-ARG
mathematician	I-ARG

may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
strongly	I-ARG

make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
field	I-ARG

Next,	O
students	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
obtain	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
variety	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
fields	I-ARG

General	B-ARG
education	I-ARG
plays	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

Science	B-ARG
today,	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
said	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

but	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
solve	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
scientists	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
combine	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
chemistry	I-ARG

In	O

although	O
textbooks	B-ARG

education	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
labelled	I-ARG

in	I-ARG

The	O
importance	O
of	O

people	O
grow	O
up,	O
the	O
arguments	O
about	O
the	O

Some	O

think	O
that,	O

need	O
playing	O
games	O
as	O

do	O

However,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
games	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
The	O
first	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
games	B-ARG
become	I-ARG
unnecessary	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
careers	I-ARG
begin	I-ARG
.	O
Someone	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
argue	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
relax	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
balanced	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
But,	O
more	B-ARG
often,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
commitment	I-ARG
force	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
abandon	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
lifelong	I-ARG
hobbies,	I-ARG
and	O
as	O
a	O
result,	O
they	B-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
effort	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
favorite	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
15	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
20	I-ARG
years	I-ARG
ago	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
country,	I-ARG
except	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
minor	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
professional	I-ARG
athletes,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
majority	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
stop	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
seriously	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
soon	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
decent	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
often	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
troublesome	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
enjoyable	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
.	O
Another	O
reason	O
should	O
be	O
mentioned	O
is	O
that	O
adults	B-ARG
often	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
pursue	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
competitive	I-ARG
activity,	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
keen	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
competition	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
winning	I-ARG
.	O
For	B-ARG
youngsters,	I-ARG
maintaining	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
desire	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
win	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
develops	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
outstanding	I-ARG
characteristics	I-ARG
whether	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
participate	I-ARG
sport	I-ARG
events	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
not	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
my	B-ARG
younger	I-ARG
sister	I-ARG
likes	I-ARG
fencing,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
thanks	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
desire	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
win,	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
gives	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
facing	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG
situation,	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
becoming	I-ARG
hurt	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
adults	B-ARG
often	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
behaviors	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
childish	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
drop	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
immediately	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
a	B-ARG
competitive	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
usually	I-ARG
finds	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
cooperate	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
colleagues	I-ARG
.	O
Because	O
of	O
that,	O
they	B-ARG
no	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
moderate	I-ARG
achievements,	I-ARG

gradually	I-ARG
lose	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
interest	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG

To	O
sum	O
up,	O
I	O
think	O
adults	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
games,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
styles	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
distinct	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
children's,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
competitive	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
enjoyable	I-ARG

Along	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
requirement	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
family	I-ARG

work,	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
leisure	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
something	I-ARG

the	O

the	I-ARG

even	I-ARG
give	I-ARG

For	O

students	B-ARG

in	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

For	O

many	B-ARG

the	I-ARG
degree	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

very	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
during	I-ARG

it	I-ARG

Most	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

also	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

where	I-ARG
each	I-ARG

For	O

after	B-ARG

a	I-ARG

a	B-ARG

very	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
review	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
reading	B-ARG
a	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
management	I-ARG
basics	I-ARG
is,	O
primarily	O
when	B-ARG
secondary	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
attain	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
undergoing	I-ARG
graduation,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
ought	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
stay	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

with	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG

away	I-ARG

during	I-ARG
such	I-ARG

money	I-ARG
management	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
taught	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
increased	I-ARG
sense	I-ARG

responsibility	I-ARG

confidence	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
while	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
kid	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
father	I-ARG

for	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
track	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
pocket	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
expenses,	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
became	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
practice	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
helped	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
planning	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
expenses	I-ARG

In	O
addition,	O
if	B-ARG
financial	I-ARG
management	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
taught	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
age,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
sense	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
understanding	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
background	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
status,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
coming	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
unrealistic	I-ARG
whims	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
fancies	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
minimized	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
buying	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
gaming	I-ARG
console	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
affluent	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
background	I-ARG

However,	O
for	B-ARG
a	I-ARG

may	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
hour	I-ARG

Hence,	O
having	B-ARG
exposed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
management	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

school	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
commitments	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
think	O
students	B-ARG
understanding	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

techniques	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
positive	I-ARG

the	O

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
smoking	B-ARG

be	I-ARG
permitted,	I-ARG
especially	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
places	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O

Smoking	B-ARG

Smoking	B-ARG

to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

Smoking	B-ARG

Personally	O
speaking,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
unfair	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
passive	I-ARG

because	O
they	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG

they	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
smoking	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG

there	B-ARG

Growing	O

in	O
a	O

way?	O
It's	O
obvious	O
that	O
violent	O
behavior	O
is	O
growing	O
more	O
in	O
films	O
in	O
recent	O
20	O

This	O
matter	O
has	O
been	O
considered	O
as	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
advertise	O
a	O
film	O
.	O
From	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
violence	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
youngsters	I-ARG
mostly	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
behaviors,	I-ARG
emotions	I-ARG
&	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
the	O
first	O
place,	O
children	B-ARG
behaviors	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
concerning	I-ARG
matter	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
trying	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
.	O
Nowadays	B-ARG
children	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
involved	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
.	O
Imagine	B-ARG
an	I-ARG
actor	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
child’s	I-ARG
favorite	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
roles	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
case,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
imitate	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
actor's	I-ARG
behaviors	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
look	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
unexpectedly	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
effected	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
child’s	I-ARG
behaviors	I-ARG
.	O
Meanwhile,	O
human	B-ARG
beings	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
sensitive,	I-ARG
especially	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
youngsters	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
dying	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
disappointing	I-ARG
happening	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
killing	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
worse	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
if	B-ARG
these	I-ARG
scenes	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
TV,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
probably	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
viewer	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
beside	O
all	O
above	O
mentioned	O
items,	O
the	B-ARG
study	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
youngsters	I-ARG
shall	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
controlled	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
a	B-ARG
child	I-ARG
watches	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
frightening	I-ARG
movie	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
he	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
this	O
condition,	O
because	O
he	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
thinking	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
movie	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
whatever	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
happened	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
it,	I-ARG
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
obvious	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
wouldn’t	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
concentrate	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
perfectly	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
the	B-ARG
study	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
youngster	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
affected	I-ARG
terribly	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
certainly	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
growing	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
violence	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
films	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
definitely	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
youngsters	I-ARG
mostly	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
study,	I-ARG
emotions	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
behaviors	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
matter	O
should	O
be	O
controlled	O
by	O
parents	O
or	O
somehow	O
by	O
directors	O

the	O

The	O

that	O
by	B-ARG

its	I-ARG
reliability	I-ARG

Some	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
disinform	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
purpose,	I-ARG
that's	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
unwise	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
conclusions	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
confident	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
information	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
Russian	B-ARG
news	I-ARG
announced	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
war	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
Osetia	I-ARG

Georgia	I-ARG

been	I-ARG

however,	I-ARG
european	I-ARG
news	I-ARG
announced	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
initiated	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
Russia	I-ARG

After	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
situation	I-ARG
became	I-ARG
clear,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
already	I-ARG
condemned	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
actions	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
Russia	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
facts	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
events	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
problem,	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
estimations,	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
conclusion	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
estimate	I-ARG
.	O
Sometimes	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
really	O
difficult	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
the	O
facts,	O
especially	O
in	O
the	O

that's	O
why	O
you	B-ARG
have	I-ARG

you	I-ARG
manage	I-ARG

some	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
possible	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
wrong	I-ARG
decision	I-ARG

you	B-ARG

someone's	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
source	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
several	B-ARG
years	I-ARG
ago	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
Moscow	I-ARG
salt	I-ARG

two	I-ARG
times	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
expensive	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
week,	I-ARG
because	I-ARG

no	I-ARG
salt	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
gossip-based	I-ARG

only	I-ARG
after	I-ARG

announcement	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
"salt-panic"	I-ARG

over	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
confident	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

The	O

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
all	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
old	I-ARG

which	I-ARG
contribute	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
our	I-ARG

that	O

As	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rapid	I-ARG
urbanization	I-ARG
process,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
rural	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
must	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
urban	I-ARG
centers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
look	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
opportunities,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
question	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
preservation	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
buildings	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
pressing	I-ARG
.	O
Because	O
of	O
that	O
need,	O
governments	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
construct	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
accommodation	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
preserving	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
buildings	I-ARG
.	O
Besides	O
that,	O
the	B-ARG
preservation	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
expensive	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
components	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
buildings	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
historical	I-ARG
values	I-ARG
.	O
Old	B-ARG
buildings	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
history	I-ARG
.	O
Tourist	B-ARG
often	I-ARG
decide	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
discover	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
visit	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
buildings	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
managers	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
attraction	I-ARG
provided	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
buildings	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
spent	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
conservation	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
the	B-ARG
preservation	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
buildings	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
conserve	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
Old	B-ARG
buildings	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
museums	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
accommodation	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
convenient	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
.	O
.	O
Many	B-ARG
cities	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
strategies	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
contains	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
unique	I-ARG

modern	I-ARG
beauty,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
preservation	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
finish	I-ARG
half	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
Overall,	O
both	O
of	O
those	O
view	O
have	O
strong	O
arguments:	O
the	O

with	O
our	O
desire	O

So	O
I	O
think	O
we	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
restore	I-ARG
those	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

I	I-ARG
ended	I-ARG
up	I-ARG

Secondly,	O

Furthermore,	O
most	B-ARG

If,	B-ARG

for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lower	I-ARG
income	I-ARG
group	I-ARG

These	B-ARG
days,	I-ARG
millions	I-ARG

people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
travel	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
pleasure	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
careers,	I-ARG
broad	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
knowledge,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
interact	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
varied	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
backgrounds	I-ARG

Moreover,	O

promote	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

On	O
the	O

hand,	O
growing	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
cheap	I-ARG
flights	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
impact	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG

Apparently,	O
more	B-ARG
flights	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
mean	I-ARG
bigger	I-ARG

busier	I-ARG
airport	I-ARG
that	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

close	I-ARG

However,	O
the	B-ARG
biggest	I-ARG
concern	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
effect	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
global	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

In	O
fact,	O
while	B-ARG

I	O
would	O

that	O
the	B-ARG
drawbacks	I-ARG

unquestionable	O
that	O

are	O
very	O
common	O
way	O
to	O
reward	O
employees	O
for	O
good	O
work	O
.	O
Besides	O
the	O
methods,	O
from	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
providing	B-ARG
professional	I-ARG
training	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
effective	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
encouraging	I-ARG
further	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
My	O
arguments	O
for	O
this	O
point	O
are	O
listed	O
follows	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
training	B-ARG
time	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
employee	I-ARG
interesting	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
outside	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
office	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
refresh	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
.	O
Clearly,	O
in	B-ARG
company	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
stressful	I-ARG
situations	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
negotiating	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG
customer,	I-ARG
complaining	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
boss,	I-ARG
etc	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
we	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
unleash	I-ARG
uncomfortable	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
training	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
making	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
friends,	I-ARG
joking	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
class,	I-ARG
enjoying	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
employees	B-ARG
fell	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
trained	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
this	O
case,	O
the	B-ARG
employees	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
investing	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
.	O
So	O
obviously,	O
they	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
term	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
another	O
thing,	O
employees	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
proud	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
provided	I-ARG
training	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
.	O
Thirdly,	O
providing	B-ARG
training	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
current	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
help	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
professional	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
.	O
Having	B-ARG
professional	I-ARG
training	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
gain	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
confidence	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
business,	I-ARG
so	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
they	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
finish	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
excellent	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
.	O
Of	O
course,	O
excellent	B-ARG
working	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
boss	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
providing	B-ARG
professional	I-ARG
training	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
reward	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
.	O
Training	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
refresh	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
happy,	I-ARG
focus	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
Taking	O
into	O
account	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
factors,	O
we	O
may	O
reach	O
the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
training	O
can	O
be	O
effective	O
in	O
encouraging	O
further	O
good	O
work	O
.	O

Attending	O
university	O
classes	O
should	O
be	O
required	O
or	O
optional	O
Attending	O
university's	O
classes	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
activities	O
that	O
students	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
.	O
However,	O
class	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
only	O
source	O
of	O

Students	O
also	O
learn	O
from	O
other	O
sources	O
such	O
as	O
experience,	O
libraries	O
and	O
other	O
people	O
.	O
I	O
think	O
going	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
optional	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
for	O
the	O
following	O
reasons	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
university	O
students	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
attend	O
class	O
is	O
sometimes	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
sources	I-ARG
outside	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
room	I-ARG
.	O
Student	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
library	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
focus	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
topic	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
I	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
close	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
department	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
.	O
She	B-ARG
learned	I-ARG
quickly	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
understood	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
fast	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
she	B-ARG
rarely	I-ARG
went	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
spent	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
confusing	I-ARG
topic	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
she	B-ARG
got	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
grade	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
graduation	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
students	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
attend	O
classes	O
because	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG

very	I-ARG
well	I-ARG

In	O
my	O
experience,	O
many	B-ARG
times	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG

because	I-ARG
my	I-ARG

I	B-ARG

As	O
a	O
result,	O
I	B-ARG

do	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
Chemistry	I-ARG

both	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
think	O
the	B-ARG

what	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
should	I-ARG

In	O
my	O
point	O

view,	O
computers	B-ARG
brought	I-ARG
convenience	I-ARG

easiness	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
since	O
they	B-ARG

increased	I-ARG
qualities	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

First,	O
computers	B-ARG
through	I-ARG

made	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
access	I-ARG

easier	I-ARG

Through	B-ARG
computers	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
collect	I-ARG
appropriate	I-ARG
data	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
quickly,	I-ARG
store	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
disc	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
want	I-ARG

use	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
needed	I-ARG

Search	B-ARG
engines	I-ARG

few	I-ARG
minutes	I-ARG
.	O
Social	B-ARG
networks	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
changed	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
sources	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

decreasing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
monopolization	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
governments	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
with	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
computers	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
search	I-ARG

can	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
it	I-ARG

different	I-ARG

Second,	O
in	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
globalized	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
computers	I-ARG
made	I-ARG

In	O
addition,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
convenient	I-ARG
because	O
you	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
need	I-ARG

just	I-ARG
click	I-ARG

your	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
convenience	I-ARG

your	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG

Internet	B-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
msn,	I-ARG
skype	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
visual	I-ARG

possible	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
via	B-ARG
skype	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
communicate	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
family	I-ARG

also	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
interviews	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

In	O
result,	O

I	O

I	O

should	I-ARG
devote	I-ARG

portion	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
health	I-ARG

and	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

The	O
first	O
reason	O
why	O
education	O
and	O

receive	O
a	O
greater	O
budget	O
is	O
the	O

I	O

that	O
decreasing	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
number	I-ARG

patients	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
hospitals	I-ARG

healthcare	I-ARG
centers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
managed	I-ARG
effectively	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
treatments	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
current	I-ARG
patients	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
society	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
educated	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
became	I-ARG
aware	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
issues	I-ARG
so	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
potential	I-ARG
precautions	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
illnesses	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
trying	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG

for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
increasing	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
patients	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
second	O
reason	O
why	O
governments	O
should	O
allocate	O
more	O
budget	O
on	O
prevention	O
from	O
illness	O
and	O
providing	O
health	O
education	O

the	O
welfare	O
of	O
the	O
society	O

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
there	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
nothing	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
human's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
happiness	I-ARG

welfare	I-ARG
come	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
health	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
a	B-ARG
government's	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
providing	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
illness	I-ARG
that	I-ARG

cause	I-ARG
misery	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG

For	O

the	B-ARG
marketing	I-ARG
campaign	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
a	B-ARG
greater	I-ARG
proportion	I-ARG

be	I-ARG

The	B-ARG

In	B-ARG

a	B-ARG

it,	I-ARG

This	B-ARG

especially	I-ARG
true	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
only	I-ARG

real	I-ARG
life	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

The	O
reason	O
why	O
most	O

that	O
in	B-ARG
some	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
very	I-ARG

This	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
mostly	I-ARG
true	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
relate	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
purpose	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
zoos	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
would	O
be	O
great	O
if	O
every	O
zoo	O
kept	O
the	O
animals	O
in	O
perfect	O
conditions,	O
but	O
regardless	O
of	O
the	O
condition,	O
zoos	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
useful	I-ARG
.	O

Serious	O
or	O
entertaining	O
movies	O
I	B-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
simple,	I-ARG
touching	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
powerful	I-ARG
.	O
Here	O
are	O
my	O
reasons	O
.	O
First,	O
most	B-ARG
serious	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
wide	I-ARG
variety	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
content	I-ARG
.	O
Entertaining	B-ARG
movies	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
created	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
amuse	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
most	B-ARG
entertaining	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
empty	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
nonsensical	I-ARG
.	O
Compared	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
entertainment	I-ARG
film,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
film	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
worthwhile	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
meaningful	I-ARG
.	O
Serious	B-ARG
movies	I-ARG
usually	I-ARG
designed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
thinking	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
love,	I-ARG
humaneness;	I-ARG
moreover,	O
it	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
point	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
dark	I-ARG
sides	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
not	O
all	O
of	O
serious	O
movies	O
are	O
boring	O
.	O
"Click"	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
interesting	I-ARG
comedy,	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
approach	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
importance	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
balanced	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
businesses	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
movie	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
humorous	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
satiric,which	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
lives,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
reminds	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
families	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
the	B-ARG
hidden	I-ARG
meanings	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
usually	I-ARG
beyond	I-ARG
words	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
images	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
ourselves	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
some	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
dark	I-ARG
sides	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
"Blood	B-ARG
diamond",	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
adaptation	I-ARG

focuses	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
link	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
diamonds	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
conflict	I-ARG
.	O
After	B-ARG
watching	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
movie,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lesson	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
jewels	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
death	I-ARG
.	O
Diamonds	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
rare	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sign	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
true	I-ARG
love;	I-ARG
indeed,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
hidden	I-ARG
meaning	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
diamond	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
cruel	I-ARG
reality	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
serious	B-ARG
movie	I-ARG
tell	I-ARG

the	O

It	O

no	O

that	O

The	B-ARG

that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

However,	O

Some	B-ARG

personal	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG

First	O

all,	O
gossip	B-ARG
involves	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
boosting	I-ARG
newspaper	I-ARG
sales	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
audience	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
unfair	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
vexation	I-ARG

a	B-ARG

an	I-ARG
excellent	I-ARG
museum	I-ARG

it	B-ARG

the	I-ARG

Last	B-ARG
year,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
went	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
Ellis	I-ARG
Island	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
immigration	I-ARG
museum,	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
symbol	I-ARG

American	I-ARG
immigration	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
immigrant	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
New	I-ARG
York	I-ARG
.	O
Through	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
exhibit,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
found	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Statue	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
Liberty	I-ARG
symbolized	I-ARG
freedom,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
Ellis	I-ARG
Island	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

where	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
immigration	I-ARG
took	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
dreams	I-ARG

Thus,	O
museums	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
history	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Secondary,	O
visiting	B-ARG

In	B-ARG
my	I-ARG

ancient	I-ARG

To	B-ARG
my	I-ARG

Jadeite	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
famous	I-ARG
artistic	I-ARG
work,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
jade,	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
a	B-ARG

Someone	B-ARG
take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

a	B-ARG

represent	I-ARG

For	O

chance	I-ARG

visit	I-ARG

it	B-ARG

Study	O
at	O
home	O
by	O
using	O
technology/study	O
or	O
traditional	O
school	O
I	B-ARG
don't	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
replace	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
.	O
Here	O
are	O
my	O
reasons	O
.	O
Studying	B-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
convenient	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
biggest	I-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
instructor	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
24	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
you	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
schedule	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
completing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
requirements	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
.	O
You	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
if	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
aren't	I-ARG
extremely	I-ARG
dedicated	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
management	I-ARG
skills,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
complete	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
attending	B-ARG
an	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
requires	I-ARG
persistence	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
patience	I-ARG
.	O
Especially	O
when	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
instructor	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
guide	I-ARG
you,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
sure	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
complete	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
requirements	I-ARG
.	O
Students	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
raise	I-ARG
questions	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
understanding	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
specific	I-ARG
topics	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
.	O
Unfortunately,	O
it	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
predicament	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
studying	B-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
.	O
Unlike	B-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
classes,	I-ARG
distance	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
courses	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
classroom,	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
surrounded	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
classmates	I-ARG
.	O
Students	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
kept	I-ARG
under	I-ARG
supervision	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
type	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
gets	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
distracted,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
distance-learning	I-ARG
program	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
there	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
-	I-ARG
socialization-	I-ARG
establishes	I-ARG
relationship	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
classmates	I-ARG
.	O
We	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home;	I-ARG
however,	O
our	B-ARG
computers	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
televisions	I-ARG
can't	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
along	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
students	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
cooperate	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
classmates	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
teamwork	I-ARG
.	O
Studying	B-ARG
alone	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
deprive	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
significant	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
opportunities	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
the	O
above	O
reasons,	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
distance	B-ARG
education	I-ARG
can't	I-ARG
replace	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
.	O

I	O
believe	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG

The	O

In	O
the	O
first	O
place,	O
the	B-ARG
establishment	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG

will	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
convenient	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
go	I-ARG

Here	O
is	O
a	O
positive	O
example:	O
Queens	B-ARG
Center	I-ARG
Mall,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
shopping	I-ARG
mall	I-ARG
located	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
Queens	I-ARG
borough	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
New	I-ARG
York	I-ARG
City,	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

services,	I-ARG
from	I-ARG

restaurants,	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
consumers	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
widely	O
thought	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
productive	I-ARG
malls	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
New	I-ARG
York	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
I	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
virtually	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
brand	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
store,	I-ARG
including	I-ARG
Macy's	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
JCPenney,	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
visited	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
concerned,	O
a	B-ARG
large	I-ARG
shopping	I-ARG
mall	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
location	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
residents	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pursue	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
leisure	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
it	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
shop	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
offer	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
vacancies	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
opening	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
stores	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
shopping	I-ARG
mall	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
looking	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
full	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG

Some	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
retirees	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
whiling	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
earning	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
Lastly,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
buy	I-ARG
goods	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
lower	I-ARG
price	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
shopping	I-ARG
center,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
save	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
hand	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
competition	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
shopping	I-ARG

For	O
the	O
above-mentioned	O
reasons,	O
I	B-ARG
advocate	I-ARG
building	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
shopping	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG

which	I-ARG

What	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
skill	O
a	O
person	O
should	O
learn	O
Some	O
people	O
think	O
that	O
life	O
is	O
a	O
struggle,	O
which	O
means	O
we	O
may	O
encounter	O
numerous	O
difficulties	O
during	O
our	O
lives	O
.	O
Accordingly,	O
stress	B-ARG
management,	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
survive	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
unbearable	I-ARG
stress,	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
skill	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
.	O
Here	O
are	O
my	O
reasons	O
.	O
Stress,	B-ARG
our	I-ARG
body's	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
responding	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
demand,	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG
.	O
Stress	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
positive	I-ARG
mobilization	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
drive	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
widely	I-ARG
thought	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
comes	I-ARG
across	I-ARG
unexpectedly	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
frustrates	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
goals	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
if	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
management	I-ARG
skill,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
critical	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
frenetic,	I-ARG
fast-paced	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
common	I-ARG
predicament	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
us,	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
senior,	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
depressed	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
stress,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
problems,	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
stress,	I-ARG
relationship	I-ARG
difficulties	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
overload	I-ARG
.	O
Some	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
regard	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
power,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
overcomes	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
obstacles	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
motivate	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
best;	I-ARG
other	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
charge	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
thoughts,	I-ARG
emotions,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
stress	B-ARG
management	I-ARG
recently	I-ARG
becomes	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
significant	I-ARG
issue	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
realization	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
stress	B-ARG
takes	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
toll	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
known	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
frequently	I-ARG
full	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
hassles,	I-ARG
frustrations,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
demands	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
reasons	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
overwhelmed	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
constant	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
some	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
problems,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
insomnia	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
headaches	I-ARG
.	O
Melancholia,	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
fatal	I-ARG
problem,	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
commit	I-ARG
suicide	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
cope	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
balancing	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
body	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
avoid	O
being	O
a	O
pessimist,	O
we	O
may	O
try	O
to	O
conquer	O
our	O
distress	O
by	O
sharing	O
our	O
worry	O
with	O
friends	O
or	O
families,	O
doing	O
exercise	O
regularly,	O
and	O
trying	O
to	O
see	O
our	O
troubles	O
in	O
a	O
different	O
way	O
.	O
For	O
the	O
above	O
reasons,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
stress	B-ARG
management	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
skill	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
solve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
.	O

Establishing	O
a	O

university	O
in	O
your	O

I	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
hear	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
plan	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
community	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
setting	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
opportunities	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
community	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pursue	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
studies,	I-ARG
creation	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG

However,	O
they	O
come	O
together	O
with	O
some	O
disadvantages	O
such	O
as	O
social	O
problems	O
.	O
This	B-ARG
new	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
allow	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
community	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
suppose	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
faraway	I-ARG
community	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
single	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
school,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
travel	I-ARG
across	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
distant	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
or	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
definitely	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
proposed	I-ARG
community's	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
.	O
Undoubtedly,	O
the	B-ARG
university	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
hire	I-ARG
professors,	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
etc	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
a	B-ARG
number	I-ARG
vacant	I-ARG
positions	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
filled	I-ARG
.	O
Also	O
there	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
opportunities	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
community	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
when	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
jobs,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
goods	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
services	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
stimulate	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
economy	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
building	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
.	O
A	B-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
come	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
communities	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
many	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
congregate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
place,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
follow	I-ARG
.	O
Traffic	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
worsen	I-ARG

More	B-ARG
wastes	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
managed	I-ARG
.	O
Maybe	B-ARG
crime	I-ARG
rate	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
social	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
impair	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG

life	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
community	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
sum,	O
I	B-ARG
myself	I-ARG
agree	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
plan	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG

I	O
believe	O
the	B-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
outweigh	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cost	I-ARG

However,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O

that	O

Television	O
versus	O
Friends	O

We	O
all	O

it	O

up	O

However,	O
have	O
you	O
ever	O
thought	O
that	O
television	O

I	B-ARG
personally	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
fact	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
harmful	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
brought	I-ARG
upon	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
since	O
people	B-ARG
watch	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much,	I-ARG
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
isolated	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
.	O
Children,	B-ARG
for	I-ARG
example,	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
movies,	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
provided	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
anything	I-ARG
else	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
practicing	I-ARG
exercise	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
apart	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
.	O
Gradually,	B-ARG
their	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
behind	I-ARG
either	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
with	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
rapid	I-ARG
change	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
standard	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
three	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
four	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
room	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
common	I-ARG
.	O
Parents	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
communicate	I-ARG

each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
room	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
consequence,	O
children	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
parents	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
able	I-ARG

their	I-ARG

care	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

In	O
this	O
way,	O
communication	B-ARG
between	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
visibly	I-ARG
destroyed	I-ARG
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
watching	B-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
unconsciously	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
sow	I-ARG
division	I-ARG

human	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
watching	B-ARG
film	I-ARG
about	I-ARG

children	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG
terrorism	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG

What	O
happens	O
if	O
they	O

act	O
exactly	O
the	O
terrorist	O

is	O
this	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
reason	O
cause	O
division	O
in	O

In	O
conclusion,	O
though	O
television	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
sides,	I-ARG
it	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
destroyed	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG

address	O
this	O

these	O

fossil	I-ARG
fuels	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
gases,	I-ARG
oil,	I-ARG

coal	I-ARG

Firstly,	O
due	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
limitation	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
renewable	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
relatively	I-ARG
expensive	I-ARG
.	O
Researches	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
renewable	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
cost	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
developing	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
afford	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
fossil	B-ARG
fuels	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
abundant	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
inexpensive	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
estimated	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
China	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
largest	I-ARG
deposit	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
coal	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
invest	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
forms	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
energy,	I-ARG
say	I-ARG
expensive	I-ARG
solar	I-ARG
batteries	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
wind	I-ARG
farms	I-ARG
.	O
Thus	O
the	B-ARG
plan	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
renewable	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
challenges	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
afford	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
reforming	I-ARG
.	O
Besides,	O
although	O
utility	B-ARG
companies	I-ARG
claim	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
renewable	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
environmentally	I-ARG
friendly;	I-ARG
these	B-ARG
new	I-ARG
forms	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
clean	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
green	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
.	O
Latest	B-ARG
studies	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
shown	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
renewable	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
problematic	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pose	I-ARG
long-term	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
hazards	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
the	B-ARG
dams	I-ARG
built	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
hydroelectricity	I-ARG
influence	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
water	I-ARG
flows	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rivers	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
drought	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
front	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
dams	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
damages	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
habitats	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
fish	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
wading	I-ARG
birds	I-ARG
.	O
More	O
importantly,	O
the	B-ARG
accumulation	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
heavy	I-ARG
metal	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
silt	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
bottom	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rivers	I-ARG
behind	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
dams	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
extremely	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
expensive	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
clean	I-ARG
up;	I-ARG
leaving	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
following	I-ARG
generations	I-ARG
.	O
Thus	O
renewable	B-ARG
resources	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
reliable	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
.	O
Admittedly	O
contemporarily	B-ARG
fossil	I-ARG
fuels	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
conundrums	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
acid	I-ARG
rain,	I-ARG
deduction	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
ozone	I-ARG
layer	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
global	I-ARG
warming;	I-ARG
these	B-ARG
problems	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
solved	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
improving	I-ARG
efficiency	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
mechanism	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
reducing	I-ARG
emissions	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example	O
we	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
chemicals	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
desulfurize	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
emissions	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
plants	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
vehicles	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
avoid	I-ARG
acid	I-ARG
rain	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
improving	I-ARG
methods	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
cheaper	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
simpler	I-ARG
compared	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
high-tech	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
renewable	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
these	I-ARG

First,	O
land	B-ARG
used	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

benefit	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

real	I-ARG

industry	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
industry,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
particularly	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
pillar	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
national	I-ARG
economy,	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
produce	I-ARG
plenty	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
profits	I-ARG
.	O
What	O
is	O
more,	O
the	B-ARG
society	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
stable	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
harmony	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
farmland	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
widely	O
acknowledged	O
that	O
more	B-ARG
farmlands	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
industries	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
opportunities	I-ARG

can	I-ARG
decrease	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
unemployment	I-ARG

Thus	O
the	B-ARG
needs	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

Second,	O
farmland,	B-ARG

It	O
is	O
clearly	O

that	O
farming,	B-ARG

In	O
addition,	O
highly	B-ARG
developed	I-ARG
agriculture	I-ARG

can	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
our	I-ARG

which	I-ARG
allow	I-ARG
us	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

Last	O
I	O
want	O
to	O

that	O
even	O
though	O
farmland,	B-ARG

According	O

With	O
the	O

For	O

we	B-ARG

only	I-ARG
mental	I-ARG

will	I-ARG
establish	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
habit	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

it,	I-ARG
giving	I-ARG

you	O

it	O

In	O
my	O

it	B-ARG

the	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

Although,	O
many	B-ARG

that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
experience,	I-ARG

I	O
think	O
it	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
interfere	I-ARG

life	I-ARG

various	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG

Having	B-ARG
jobs	I-ARG

affect	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
student	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
divert	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
from	I-ARG

would	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
childhood	I-ARG
phase	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
A	B-ARG
student	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
lots	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
today's	I-ARG
competitive	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prove	I-ARG
himself	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
grades	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
involved	I-ARG
himself	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
rest	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
extra	I-ARG
burden	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
jobs	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
responsibilities	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
attendance,	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
extra	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
stress,	I-ARG
tension	I-ARG

tiredness	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
won't	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
able	I-ARG

get	I-ARG
proper	I-ARG
time	I-ARG

would	B-ARG
affect	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
mental	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
health	I-ARG

Another	O
reason,	O
jobs	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
divert	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG

If	B-ARG

started	I-ARG
earning	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
earlier	I-ARG

their	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG

they	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
attracted	I-ARG
towards	I-ARG
money	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
feel	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
independent	I-ARG

would	I-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
money	I-ARG

This	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
affect	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
studies,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
loose	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
interest	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
they	B-ARG
drop	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition	O
to	O
this,	O
the	B-ARG
main	I-ARG
drawback	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
teenagers	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
miss	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fun	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
childhood	I-ARG
time	I-ARG

He	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
miss	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
childhood	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
hang	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
friends,	I-ARG
clubs	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
fun	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
interaction	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
prove	I-ARG
themselves,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
childhood	I-ARG
phase	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
return	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
they	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
possible	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
for	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
teenager	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG

Having	B-ARG
job	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
affect	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
health,	I-ARG
divert	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG

take	I-ARG

In	B-ARG
modern	I-ARG

I	B-ARG

In	O
addition,	O
such	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
remarkable	I-ARG
effect	I-ARG

incorporation	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
all	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

Increasing	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
motivation	I-ARG

Besides,	O
pupils	B-ARG
often	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
tangible	I-ARG
competence	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
that	I-ARG

When	B-ARG
the	I-ARG

internal	I-ARG
obligation	I-ARG

manage	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	B-ARG
strongly	I-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
group	I-ARG

Should	O

that	O

therefore	O
do	O
not	O

our	O
attention	O

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
we	B-ARG
must	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
safely	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
comfortably	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG

Many	B-ARG
scientific	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG

revealed	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
detriment	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
zoos	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
like	B-ARG
we,	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
beings,	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
delivered	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
genetic	I-ARG
instincts	I-ARG
.	O
Skills	O
which	O
help	O
them	O
live	O
and	O
survive	O
in	O
their	O
residing	O
areas	O
.	O
When	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
captivate	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
style	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
unfamiliar	I-ARG
with,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
begin	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
loose	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
in-born	I-ARG
instincts	I-ARG

Hence,	O
when	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
released	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
worst	I-ARG
case,	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
escape,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
act	I-ARG
disorientated	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
contributes	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
animal	I-ARG
mortality	I-ARG
rate	I-ARG

In	O
addition	O

the	O

various	B-ARG

a	I-ARG

I	I-ARG

opt	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
second	I-ARG
one	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O
my	B-ARG
country	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

any	I-ARG
treatment	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
centre	I-ARG

my	I-ARG
co-citizens	I-ARG

these	I-ARG
land	I-ARG

This	B-ARG

Secondly,	O
the	B-ARG
centre	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
economy	I-ARG

The	B-ARG

only	I-ARG
thirty	I-ARG

as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
market	I-ARG
part	I-ARG

The	B-ARG

raise	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

developing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

example,	O
the	B-ARG
dates	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
agriculture	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
centre	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
agriculture	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
research	I-ARG

how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG

this	I-ARG
product,	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
treat	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Palme	I-ARG

how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
treat	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
land	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
palms	I-ARG

Another	B-ARG
reason	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
centre	I-ARG

research	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
agriculture	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
centre	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
one	I-ARG

create	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG

Obviously,	O
showing	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
exploit	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
land	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
agriculture	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
push	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
field	I-ARG

agriculture	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
working	I-ARG

other	I-ARG
field	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
Some	O
people	O
think	O
that	O
a	B-ARG
centre	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
because	O
we	B-ARG

For	O
me	O

that	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

of	I-ARG

When	B-ARG

The	B-ARG
fact	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
learning	B-ARG

With	B-ARG
the	I-ARG

Reading	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
things	I-ARG

listening	I-ARG

Learning	B-ARG

success	I-ARG

The	O

the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
way	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

many	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG

It	O

that	O

possibilities	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG

for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lower	I-ARG

group	I-ARG

These	B-ARG
days,	I-ARG
millions	I-ARG

can	I-ARG
travel	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
work	I-ARG

pleasure	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
careers,	I-ARG
broad	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
knowledge,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
interact	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
varied	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
backgrounds	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
travels	B-ARG
also	I-ARG
help	I-ARG

promote	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tourist	I-ARG
industry	I-ARG
development,	I-ARG
boost	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
economy	I-ARG

many	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
growing	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
cheap	I-ARG
flights	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
impact	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
.	O
Apparently,	O
more	B-ARG
flights	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
mean	I-ARG
bigger	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
busier	I-ARG
airport	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
grown	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
live	I-ARG

work	I-ARG
close	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
it	I-ARG

However,	O
the	B-ARG
biggest	I-ARG
concern	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
effect	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
global	I-ARG
warming	I-ARG
.	O
Burning	B-ARG
plane	I-ARG
fuel	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
releases	I-ARG
carbon	I-ARG

into	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Earth	I-ARG

heat	I-ARG
up	I-ARG

In	O
fact,	O
while	B-ARG
many	I-ARG

made	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
CO2	I-ARG

nothing	I-ARG

done	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
would	O
argue	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
drawbacks	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
cheap	I-ARG
air	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

it	O

public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rising	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
private	I-ARG
cars	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
creating	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
the	B-ARG
using	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
reduces	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
.	O
Cars	B-ARG
depend	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
gasoline,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
non-renewable	I-ARG
resource	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
the	B-ARG
more	I-ARG
cars	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
faster	I-ARG
gasoline	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
the	O
contrary,	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
efficiently	I-ARG
used,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
gasoline	I-ARG
consuming	I-ARG
per	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
lower	I-ARG
.	O
And	O
this	B-ARG
definitely	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
reserve	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
invaluable	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
resource,	I-ARG
gasoline	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
public	B-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
solve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
air	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
.	O
Averagely,	O
public	B-ARG
transports	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
gasoline	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
carry	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
private	I-ARG
cars	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transports,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
gas	I-ARG
exhaust	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
pumped	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
air	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
bear	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
stuffy	I-ARG
situation	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
roads,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
full	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
fumes	I-ARG
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
using	B-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
safer	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
private	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
.	O
According	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
National	I-ARG
Safety	I-ARG
Council,	I-ARG
riding	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
bus	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
170	I-ARG
times	I-ARG
safer	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
private	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
.	O
Thus	O
there	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
reason	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
governments	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
hesitate	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
invest	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
healthy,	I-ARG
safe	I-ARG

economical	I-ARG
way	I-ARG

In	O
short,	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
for	O
certain	O
that	O
spending	B-ARG
money	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
improving	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
key	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
protect	I-ARG
our	I-ARG

Furthermore,	O
the	B-ARG

have	I-ARG
got	I-ARG
further	I-ARG
worsened	I-ARG
.	O
Thirdly,	O
if	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
hard,	I-ARG
luck	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
shine	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
steps	I-ARG
further	I-ARG
ahead	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
actual	I-ARG
target	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
my	B-ARG
boss	I-ARG
worked	I-ARG
tirelessly	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
promotion	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
looked	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
aspect	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
needed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
qualify	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
promotion	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
realized	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
master's	I-ARG
degree	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
credential	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
outperform	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
competitors	I-ARG
.	O
Although	O
he	B-ARG
had	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
commitments	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
work,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
somehow	I-ARG
managed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
complete	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
degree	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
eligible	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
apply	I-ARG
.	O
At	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
promotion	I-ARG
amidst	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
stiff	I-ARG
competition	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
got	I-ARG
nominated	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
scholarship	I-ARG
since	O
he	B-ARG
had	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
credentials	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
officers	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
capacity	I-ARG
.	O
Although	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
lucky,	I-ARG
depending	B-ARG
on	I-ARG
luck	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
.	O
Hence	O
I	B-ARG
strongly	I-ARG
believe	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
disappoint	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
luck	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
.	O

Should	O
students	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
attend	O
classes?	O
The	O
issue	O
at	O
hand	O
is	O
whether	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
obligatory	O
for	O
university	O
students	O
to	O
attend	O
classes	O
.	O
This	O
is	O
an	O
interesting	O
question	O
because	O
it	O
affects	O
a	O
great	O
amount	O
of	O
students	O
worldwide	O

Nonetheless	O
there	O
are	O
various	O
different	O
policies	O
regarding	O
this	O
topic	O

An	O
important	O
aspect	O
might	O
be	O
whether	O
one	O
desires	O
to	O
optimize	O
the	O
learned	O
knowledge	O
or	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
valuable	O
experiences	O
for	O
the	O
students	O
.	O
However,	O
to	O
my	O
mind	O
students	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
improves	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
motivation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
teaches	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
a	O
liberal	O
policy	O
is	O
very	O
feasible	O
.	O
Checking	O
for	O
attendance	O
requires	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
bureaucracy	O
.	O
Especially	O
for	O
larger	O
classes	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
check	O
for	O
everybody	O
to	O
attend	O
.	O
So	O
an	O
optional	O
attendance	O
saves	O
time	O
and	O
money	O
.	O
Secondly,	O
some	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own,	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
instance,	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
reading	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
textbook	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
problem	I-ARG
occurs	I-ARG
especially	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lecturer	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
lethargic	I-ARG
.	O
By	B-ARG
letting	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
escape	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
teaching	I-ARG
.	O
Thus	O
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
save	I-ARG
precious	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
dive	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
syllabus	I-ARG
independently	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
being	B-ARG
free	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
stay	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
improves	I-ARG
flexibility	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
therefore	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Sometimes	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
wild	I-ARG
party	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
Thursday	I-ARG
night	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
already	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
midnight	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lecture	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
Friday	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
morning	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
liberal	I-ARG
policy	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
postpone	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
afternoon	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
gives	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
feeling	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
freedom	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
improves	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
efficiency	I-ARG
.	O
Research	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
shown	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
satisfied	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
aspects,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
perform	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
psychology	O
knows	O
two	O
types	O
of	O
motivation	O
.	O
There	O
is	O
intrinsic	O
motivation	O
which	O
comes	O
from	O
your	O
own	O
mindset	O
.	O
And	O
there	O
is	O
extrinsic	O
motivation	O
which	O
comes	O
from	O
the	O
praise	O
and	O
laud	O
of	O
other	O
people	O
.	O
Intrinsic	B-ARG
motivation	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
known	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
desirable	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
well-being	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
in	B-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
gain	I-ARG
intrinsic	I-ARG
motivation	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
aware	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
strengths	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
aims	I-ARG
.	O
By	B-ARG
giving	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
freedom	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
attendance	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
thinking	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
decided	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
motivate	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
crucial	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
duration	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
clear	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
optional	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
hold	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
belief	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
improvement	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
current	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG

Living	O

I	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
and	O
I	B-ARG
think	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
advantages,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
weather,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
the	B-ARG
first	I-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
obtain	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
items	I-ARG
.	O
One	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
conditions	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
weather	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
population	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
exist	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
in	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
crowded	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
traffic	I-ARG
.	O
Living	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
air	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
sound	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
healthier	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
consequences	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
happiness	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
in	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
foods	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
materials	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
healthier	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
fresh	I-ARG
foods	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
fruits	I-ARG
.	O
Regardless	O
of	O
some	O
exceptions,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
obvious	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
towns	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
healthier	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
another	B-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
towns	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
costs	I-ARG
.	O
Living	B-ARG
cost	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
concerns	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
then,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
cost	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
fewer	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
in	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
houses	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
landscapes,	I-ARG
also	O
because	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
crowded	I-ARG
spaces	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
services	I-ARG
.	O
Transportation	B-ARG
cost	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
traffic	I-ARG
so	O
that	O
we	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
save	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	B-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
and	O
I	O
think	O
it	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
stress,	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
weather	I-ARG
conditions	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
also,	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
relationship	I-ARG
within	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
small	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
therefore	O
on	B-ARG
big	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
depress	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
.	O
However	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
obvious	O
fact	O
that	O
people	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
town	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
happiness	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
friendship	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
illness	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG

Personally,	O

the	O
major	O
cause	O
that	O
leads	O
to	O
urban	O
migration	O
of	O
young	O
adults	O
is	O
that	O
cities	B-ARG
often	I-ARG
offer	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
well-paid	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
chances	I-ARG
compared	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
rural	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
.	O
Obviously,	O
many	B-ARG
large	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
universities	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
locate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
hailed	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
promising	I-ARG
lands	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore	O
they	B-ARG
move	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pursue	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
standard	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
gradate	I-ARG
stays	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
leaving	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
college	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
seeks	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
salary	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
returning	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
village	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
farm	I-ARG
work,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
perhaps	I-ARG
buy	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
house	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
car	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
short	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
this	O
phenomenon	O
sometimes	O
poses	O
several	O
negative	O
consequences	O
.	O
There	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
burgeoning	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
countryside	I-ARG
flocking	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
gives	I-ARG
rise	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
overpopulation	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
cities	B-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
adequate	I-ARG
space	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
thousands	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
dwellers	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
poor	I-ARG
housing	I-ARG
conditions	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
sanitation	I-ARG
.	O
Additionally,	O
it	B-ARG
might	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
strain	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
young	B-ARG

it	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
yield	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

A	O

proportion	O

In	O
today's	O

the	O

provide	O

healthcare	O
and	O
health	O
education	O
to	O
their	O
citizens	O
.	O
I	O
completely	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
governments	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
devote	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
greater	I-ARG
portion	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
budgets	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
precautions	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
first	O
reason	O
why	O
education	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
preventative	I-ARG
measures	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
receive	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
greater	I-ARG
budget	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
improvements	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
decreasing	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
patients	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
hospitals	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
healthcare	I-ARG
centers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
managed	I-ARG
effectively	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
treatments	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
current	I-ARG
patients	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
society	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
educated	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
became	I-ARG
aware	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
issues	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
precautions	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
illnesses	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
trying	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
treatment	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
increasing	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
patients	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
second	O
reason	O
why	O
governments	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
allocate	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
budget	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
prevention	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
illness	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
providing	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
welfare	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
there	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
nothing	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
human's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
happiness	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
welfare	I-ARG
come	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
a	B-ARG
government's	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
providing	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
illness	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
misery	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
the	B-ARG
marketing	I-ARG
campaign	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
Ministry	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
Health	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
Turkey	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
aimed	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
among	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
youth	I-ARG
increased	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
well-being	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
quit	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
adapted	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
lifestyle	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
campaign	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
a	B-ARG
greater	I-ARG
proportion	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
budget	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
allotted	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
prevention	I-ARG
issues	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
comparison	I-ARG
with	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG

Despite	O
the	O

the	B-ARG

effective	B-ARG

can	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG

in	B-ARG
many	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
cases	I-ARG
when	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
possible,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
apperant	I-ARG
example	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
tests	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
allow	I-ARG
team-working	I-ARG

Let's	B-ARG
imagine	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
perform	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
discuss	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG

you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
working	I-ARG

standardized	I-ARG
tests	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG

Testing	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
aspect	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
majority	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
tests	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
allow	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
if	B-ARG

as	I-ARG

acing	I-ARG
your	I-ARG

you	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG

your	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
the	B-ARG

When	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
work	I-ARG

our	B-ARG

When	B-ARG

that	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
support	I-ARG
states	I-ARG

ban	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
because	O
smoking	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
damages	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
restaurant's	I-ARG
environment,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
imposes	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
threat	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
others'	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
although	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
strong	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
assert	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
prohibited	I-ARG
everywhere	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society,	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
restaurant	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
considered	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ignorance	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
others'	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
generally	O
believed	O
that,	O
the	B-ARG
second-hand	I-ARG
smoke,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
comes	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
smoker's	I-ARG
mouth,	I-ARG
puts	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
greater	I-ARG
threat	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
surrounding	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
smoker	I-ARG
himself	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	B-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
restaurant,	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
smoke	I-ARG
unconsciously	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
under	I-ARG
attacked	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
because	O
some	B-ARG
burned	I-ARG
substance	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
cigarette	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
deteriorate	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person's	I-ARG
respiratory	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
he/she	I-ARG
inhales	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
smoking	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
restaurants	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
strictly	I-ARG
banned	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
makes	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
restaurant	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
polluted	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
threatens	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
customer's	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
even	O
though	O
some	O
customers	O
do	O
not	O
worry	O
about	O
the	O
threat	O
that	O
second-hand	O
smoke	O
imposes	O
on	O
them,	O
the	B-ARG
disgusting	I-ARG
smoke	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
severely	I-ARG
affect	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
appetite,	I-ARG
or,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
words,	I-ARG
spoil	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
meals	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
unpleasant	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
smoke	I-ARG
exhaled	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
smoker	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
uncomfortable	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
disgusted,	I-ARG
thus	I-ARG
affecting	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
mood	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
meals	I-ARG
.	O
This,	B-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
hand,	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
indirectly	I-ARG
decrease	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
restaurants'	I-ARG
popularity	I-ARG
because	O
fewer	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
willing	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
consume	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
unpleasant	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG
.	O
Lastly,	O
smoking	B-ARG
does	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
smoker	I-ARG
himself	I-ARG
.	O
Not	B-ARG
only	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
aggravate	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
health,	I-ARG
making	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
respiratory	I-ARG
diseases,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
damages	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
image	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
reputation	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
especially	I-ARG
true	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
smoker	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
popular	I-ARG
political	I-ARG
figure	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
entertainmening	I-ARG
celebrity,	I-ARG
because	O
most	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
restaurants	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
impolite	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
.	O
At	O
this	O
point,	O
the	B-ARG
public	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
believe	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
smoker	I-ARG
lacks	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG
civility	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
encouraged	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
leader	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
smoking	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
restaurant	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
harmful	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
disrespectable	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
spoils	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
smoker's	I-ARG
reputation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
threats	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
health	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
unwise	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
smoke	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
restaurant	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
places,	I-ARG

relevant	I-ARG
state	I-ARG

First,	O
having	B-ARG

doing	B-ARG

prevent	I-ARG

short-sighted	I-ARG

My	B-ARG
neighbor	I-ARG

once	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
computer	I-ARG
engineer	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
company	I-ARG

He	B-ARG
ate	I-ARG
fast	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
everyday	I-ARG

never	I-ARG
went	I-ARG
out	I-ARG

When	B-ARG
he	I-ARG
found	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
too	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

he	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG

He	B-ARG
started	I-ARG

Also,	O
doing	B-ARG
something	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
boring,	I-ARG
having	B-ARG
hobbies	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
refresh	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
at	B-ARG
school,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
breaks	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
relax	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
few	I-ARG
minutes	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
next	I-ARG
class	I-ARG

Humans	B-ARG
are	I-ARG

robots;	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can't	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
twenty-four	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG
.	O
Doing	B-ARG
sports	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
hobbies	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
short	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
recharge	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
batteries	I-ARG
.	O
Last,	O
we	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
least	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
hobby,	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
off,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
emotion	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
depressed	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
pressured	I-ARG
.	O
Playing	B-ARG
musical	I-ARG
instrument	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
way,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
classical	I-ARG
guitar	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
difficulties	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
studies,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
guitar	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
song	I-ARG
Green	I-ARG
Sleeves	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
makes	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
gives	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
confidence	I-ARG
.	O
Although	O
it	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
times	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG

doing	B-ARG

can	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
refreshed	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
release	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG

sadness	I-ARG

Hence,	O
I	O
think	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
hobbies	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O

Government	O
should	O
regard	O
investing	O
in	O
building	O
roads	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
The	O
population	O
explosion	O
results	O
in	O
the	O
high	O

from	O
pollution,	O
noisy	O
and	O
casualty	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
.	O
From	O
my	O
perspective,	O
the	B-ARG
most	I-ARG
possible	I-ARG
solution	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
improving	I-ARG
roads	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
highways	I-ARG
because	O
of	O
three	O
crucial	O
reasons	O
.	O
First	O
and	O
foremost,	O
we	B-ARG
all	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
upgrading	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
surely	I-ARG
aggravate	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
accidents	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
buses,	I-ARG
cars	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
trains	I-ARG
regularly	I-ARG
emit	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
noxious	I-ARG
gas	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
causes	I-ARG
lots	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
fatal	I-ARG
diseases	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
lung	I-ARG
cancer	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
pneumonia	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
the	B-ARG
sound	I-ARG
emanates	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
engines	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
worsen	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
hearing	I-ARG
.	O
Most	O
importantly,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
accidents	I-ARG
happening	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
roads	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
country,	I-ARG
buses	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
attributed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
skyrocketing	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
accidents	I-ARG
.	O
Each	O
year,	O
Vietnam	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
approximately	I-ARG
twelve	I-ARG
thousand	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
die	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
accidents	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
equivalent	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
death	I-ARG
toll	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tsunami	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
Japan	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
investing	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
roads	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
highways	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
broaden	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
area	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
allow	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
Not	B-ARG
only	I-ARG
buses	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
vehicles	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
move	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
roads	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	B-ARG
always	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
everybody	I-ARG
rushes	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
roads	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
hastily	I-ARG
goes	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
extremely	I-ARG
troublesome	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
escape	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
crowd	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
roads	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
hour	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
contrast,	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
roads	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
enlarged,	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
short	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
hardly	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
collisions	I-ARG
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
spending	B-ARG
on	I-ARG
renovating	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
highways	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
roads	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
.	O
All	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
afraid	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
moving	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rough	I-ARG
roads	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
lots	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
portholes	I-ARG
.	O
Those	B-ARG
bad	I-ARG
conditions	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
terrible	I-ARG
accidents	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
worried	I-ARG
.	O
We	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
accuse	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
drivers	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
causing	I-ARG
accidents	I-ARG
because	O
a	B-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG
belongs	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
authorities	I-ARG
.	O
What's	B-ARG
more,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
smooth	I-ARG
surface	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG

movement	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
safer	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
a	O

the	B-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
upgrading	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
roads	I-ARG

By	B-ARG
listening	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
family	I-ARG

advice,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
definitely	I-ARG
avoid	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
unexpected	I-ARG
things	I-ARG

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
finding	B-ARG
out	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
independent	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
mature	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
one	O
thing,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
grate	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
missed	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
yourself	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
a	B-ARG
friend	I-ARG
told	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
skydiving	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
dangerous	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
told,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
fail	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
wonderful	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
fall	I-ARG
freely	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
family	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
accidentally	I-ARG
harm	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
giving	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
advice	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
time	I-ARG

You	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
grow	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
dependent	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
reliant	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
contrast,	O
free	B-ARG
yourself	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
desire	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
notice	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
consequences	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
.	O
According	O
to	O
myself,	O
both	O
ways	O
are	O
good,	O
but	O
I	O
prefer	O
the	O
latter	O
.	O
It	O
is	O
because	O
growth	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
process	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
indispensable	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
experiencing	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
myself,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
obey	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
advice	I-ARG

Parents	O

why	O

the	O

the	O

In	O
summary,	O
each	O
way	O
learning	O
life	O

its	O

But	O
to	O
me,	O
learning	B-ARG
about	I-ARG

more	I-ARG
appropriate	I-ARG

These	B-ARG
changes	I-ARG
make	I-ARG

easy-to-use	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
time-saving	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
extent	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O
people	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
since	I-ARG
food	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
time-consuming	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
such	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
change	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
liberated	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
housewives	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
tedious	I-ARG
cooking	I-ARG
process	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
gave	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
additional	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
something	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
meaningful	I-ARG
like	I-ARG

doing	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job	I-ARG

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
more	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
sleep	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bit	I-ARG
later	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG

they	B-ARG
only	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
couple	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG

prepare	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

At	O
the	O

point,	O
since	B-ARG
food	I-ARG
preparation	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
certainly	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
preserve	I-ARG
diverse	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
variety	I-ARG

dishes	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
meal	I-ARG

conclusion,	O
the	B-ARG
time-saving,	I-ARG

Nevertheless,	O
for	O
the	O
reasons	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
presented	O
above,	O
I	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
assert	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
change	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
improved	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
significantly	I-ARG
.	O

Are	O
parents	O
best	O
teachers?	O
It	O
is	O
obvious	O
that	O
parents	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
babies	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
walk	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
speak	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
parents	B-ARG
provide	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children's	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
children	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
taught	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG
things,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
influence	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
baby,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
Parents	B-ARG
always	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
explain	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
describe	I-ARG
tenderly	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
simple	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
baby	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
parents	B-ARG
bring	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
wonderful	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
colorful	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
baby's	I-ARG
little	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
parents	B-ARG
train	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
always	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
basically	I-ARG
say	I-ARG
thanks	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
apology	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
one	O
hand,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
common	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
explain	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
children	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
shown	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
behave	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
easy	O
but	O
this	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
influence	I-ARG
positively	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
children's	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
Third,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
parents	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
ones	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
loves	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
they	B-ARG
tend	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
advice	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
.	O
Unlike	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
professional,	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
support	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
skill	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
communicate	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
habit	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
parents'	B-ARG
support	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
factor	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
succeed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
parents	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
advice	I-ARG
.	O
Based	O
on	O
love,	O
they	O
always	O
try	O
their	O
best	O
to	O
make	O
good	O
condition	O
for	O
their	O
children	O
development	O
in	O
order	O

Tv	O
has	O
NO	O
negative	O
effects	O
on	O
children	O
Nowadays,	O
we	O
have	O
undergone	O
many	O
technology	O
innovations	O
such	O
as	O
Tv	O
.	O
Many	O
people	O
say	O
that	O
television	O
has	O
negative	O
effects	O
on	O
children,	O
since	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
violent	O
or	O
inappropriate	O
for	O
children	O
.	O
However,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
television	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
positive	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
.	O
There	O
are	O
two	O
reasons	O
to	O
support	O
my	O
idea	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
television	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
useful	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
educational	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
.	O
Not	B-ARG
only	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
up-to-date	I-ARG
news,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
educational	I-ARG
purposes	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
children	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
wisely,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	B-ARG
Korea,	I-ARG
there's	I-ARG
program	I-ARG
called	I-ARG
EBS	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
targeted	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
teenager	I-ARG
.	O
We	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
EBS	I-ARG
lecture	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
documentary	I-ARG
films	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
man	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
Korea	I-ARG
.	O
Using	B-ARG
those	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
let	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
inspirations	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
Tv	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
helpful	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
relieve	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
stresses	I-ARG
.	O
There	O
are	O
many	O
Tv	O
programs	O
such	O
as	O
sports	O
programs	O
.	O
Many	B-ARG
children	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
stresses	I-ARG
recently,	I-ARG
since	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
programs,	I-ARG
it's	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
relieve	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
stresses	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
an	O
example,	O
I	B-ARG
got	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
I	B-ARG
was	I-ARG
quite	I-ARG
aggressive,	I-ARG
however	O
.	O
After	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
soccer	I-ARG
match	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
Korea	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
Japan,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
gone	I-ARG
.	O
Instead,	O
this	B-ARG
soccer	I-ARG
match	I-ARG
helped	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
continue	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
school,	I-ARG
since	O
it	B-ARG
helped	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
relieve	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
of	O
course,	O
the	B-ARG
television	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
programs,	I-ARG
however,	O
if	B-ARG
children	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
Tv	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
wisely,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
positive	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
.	O
Now	O
that,	O
it	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
useful	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
educational	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
quite	I-ARG
helpful	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
relieve	I-ARG
stresses	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
these	O
reasons,	O
I	B-ARG
strongly	I-ARG
disagree	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
statement	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
children	I-ARG

out-of-date	O

I	O

businesses	B-ARG
had	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
employ	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
workers	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
because	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
main	O
crucial	O
reasons	O
.	O
First	O
and	O
foremost,	O
various	B-ARG
ideas	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
creativity	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
indispensable	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
flourish	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
invaluable	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
senior	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
pass	I-ARG
down	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
apprentices	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
job,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
regularly	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
creative	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
novel	I-ARG
ideas	I-ARG
.	O
What's	O
more,	O
the	B-ARG
rapid	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
field	I-ARG
nowadays	I-ARG
requires	I-ARG
precise	I-ARG
updates	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
access	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
the	B-ARG
youngsters	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
capable	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
meeting	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
standards	I-ARG
.	O
More	O
importantly,	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
activeness,	I-ARG
inventiveness	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
enterprise	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
allow	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
complete	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
perfectly	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
vital	I-ARG
factors	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
decide	I-ARG
whether	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
thrive	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
the	B-ARG
staff	I-ARG
soon	I-ARG
gets	I-ARG
boring	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
stable	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
At	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
presume	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
securing	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
manage	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Thereafter,	O
the	B-ARG
bulk	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
realize	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
promotion	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
competition	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
assist	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

horizons	I-ARG
also	O

Many	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG

they	B-ARG
don	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
want	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
monotonous	I-ARG

passive	I-ARG
ones	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
same-old-same-old	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
soon	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
depressed,	I-ARG
so	O
this	B-ARG
situation	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
adverse	I-ARG
impact	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
enterprise	I-ARG

Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
the	B-ARG
economic	I-ARG
crisis	I-ARG

recession	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
tremendous	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
unemployment	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
the	B-ARG
businesses	I-ARG
ought	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
recruit	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
workers	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
tackle	I-ARG
this	I-ARG

earn	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
living	I-ARG

Furthermore,	O
the	B-ARG
factories	I-ARG

will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
abundant	I-ARG
human	I-ARG

It's	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
responsibilities	I-ARG

daily	I-ARG

Starting	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
adulthood,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
strictly	I-ARG
bounded	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
responsibilities	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG

We	B-ARG

at	I-ARG

wake	I-ARG
up,	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
we	I-ARG

behave	I-ARG

Every	B-ARG
action	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
watched	I-ARG
closely	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
judged	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
community	I-ARG

But	O
during	B-ARG
our	I-ARG
childhood,	I-ARG
though	I-ARG
responsibilies	I-ARG
exist,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

Being	B-ARG
late	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
school	I-ARG

at	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
you	I-ARG

consequences	I-ARG

that	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
.	O
Another	B-ARG
great	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
possibility	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
new	I-ARG

interesting	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG

live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
single	I-ARG
day	I-ARG

Being	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
single	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
you	I-ARG

there	I-ARG

you	I-ARG

There	B-ARG

things	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
childhood	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
period	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
surprised	I-ARG
most	I-ARG

Using	B-ARG
your	I-ARG
imagination	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
saying	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
freely	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
about	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
child	I-ARG

things	I-ARG

say	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
adults,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
freedom	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
yourself	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
developing	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
colorful	I-ARG
imagination	I-ARG

In	B-ARG
adulthood,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
forced	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG

their	I-ARG

Childhood,	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
aspects,	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
happiest	I-ARG
period	I-ARG

our	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
.	O
It's	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
nature	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
childhood	I-ARG

children,	I-ARG

also	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
our	I-ARG

changed	I-ARG
when	I-ARG

Although	O

life	B-ARG
changes	I-ARG
rapidly,	I-ARG
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
past	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
about,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
mistakes,	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
fields	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
the	B-ARG
predecessors'	I-ARG
mistakes	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
past	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
everyone's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
short	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
risk	I-ARG
trying	I-ARG
anything	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
prepare,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
other's	I-ARG
mistakes	I-ARG
so	O
that	O
we	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
avoid	I-ARG
making	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
ones	I-ARG
.	O
Each	B-ARG
mistake,	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
smallest	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
bigger	I-ARG
one,	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
treasure	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
experience,	I-ARG
which,	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
full	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of,	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
well-prepared	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
complicated	I-ARG
situations	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
life	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
past	B-ARG
obviously	I-ARG
saves	I-ARG
ourselves	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bunch	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
failures	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
times	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
people's	B-ARG
success	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
past	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
significant	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
mistakes	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
predecessors'	I-ARG
mistakes	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
indirect	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
goals,	I-ARG
others'	B-ARG
accomplishment	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
served	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
direct	I-ARG
way	I-ARG

By	B-ARG
looking	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
targets,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
mine,	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
practice	I-ARG

Modern	B-ARG

people	I-ARG

First,	O
it's	O
true	O
watching	B-ARG
TV	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
day,	I-ARG
nevertheless	O
it	B-ARG
makes	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
start	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
conversation	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG

Families	B-ARG

either	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG

friends	I-ARG

For	O
example	O
my	B-ARG
friends	I-ARG

I	I-ARG
used	I-ARG

enjoy	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
VHS	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
was	I-ARG

similar	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
cinema	I-ARG

Third,	O
TV	B-ARG

be	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

Moreover,	O

up,	O

your	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
family	I-ARG

As	O

as	O
it's	B-ARG
one	I-ARG
way	I-ARG

recent	I-ARG

on	O

I	O
think	O
TV	B-ARG
helps	I-ARG

Parents	O
can	O
help	O
their	O
teenage	O
children	O
prepare	O
for	O
adult	O
life	O
Nowadays,	O
the	O
society	O
has	O
become	O
exceedingly	O
competitive	O
than	O
ever	O
before,	O
parents	O
have	O
the	O
responsibilitis	O
to	O
teach	O
their	O
children	O
to	O
survive	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
indepedent	O
from	O
them,	O
just	O
as	O
animals	O
teach	O
their	O
offspring	O
skills	O
of	O
finding	O
foods	O
.	O
Parents	O
can	O
use	O
many	O
methods	O
to	O
guide	O
them	O
to	O
achieve	O
that,	O
for	O
example,	O
asking	O
them	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
housework	O
or	O
clean	O
the	O
rooms	O
by	O
themselves	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
views,	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
teenage	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
when	B-ARG
children	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
themselves,	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
pocket	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
oppertunity	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
Take	O
me	O
as	O
an	O
example,	O
when	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
16,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
found	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
summer	I-ARG
vacation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
earned	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
.	O
At	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
beginning	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
semester,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
told	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
buy	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
text	I-ARG
book	I-ARG
.	O
Unfortunately,	O
I	B-ARG
spent	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
salary	I-ARG
hanging	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
I	B-ARG
finally	I-ARG
realized	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
plan	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
money,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
influence	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
by	B-ARG
taking	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
certainly	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
responsible	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
anything	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
done	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
if	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
frequently	I-ARG
late	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
work,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
payment	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
fire	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
.	O
To	B-ARG
compare	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
suffer	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
.	O
Under	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
circumstances,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
obey	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rule	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
to	B-ARG
help	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
adapt	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
let	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
.	O
Due	O
to	O
the	O
reasons	O
given	O
above,	O
to	B-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
prepared	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O

Children	O
should	O
grow	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
big	O
city!	O
It’s	B-ARG
certainly	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
grow	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
.	O
Of	O
course	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
choose	O
a	O
good	O
neighborhood	O
.	O
I	B-ARG
hold	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
belief	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
two	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
reasons,	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
reasons	I-ARG
.	O
Some	O
people	O
thinks	O
that	O
if	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
grows	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
computer	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
video-game,	I-ARG
but	O
this	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
true	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
neighborhood	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
.	O
My	B-ARG
friends	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
soccer,	I-ARG
bike,	I-ARG
climb	I-ARG
trees	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
stuff	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
.	O
We	B-ARG
did	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
video-games,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
wasn't	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
activity	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
grew	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
countryside	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
said	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pass	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
test	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
enter	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
another	O
downside	O
of	O
growing	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
countryside	O
.	O
In	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
qualified	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
access	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
.	O
Growing	B-ARG
up	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
countryside	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
experience,	I-ARG
you	B-ARG
won’t	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
gossips	I-ARG
everywhere,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
limited	I-ARG
.	O
If	O
someday	O
I	O
have	O
children,	O
I’m	O
absolutely	O
sure	O
that	O
they	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
grow	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
neighborhood	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O

Parents	O
are	O
the	O
best	O
teachers	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
more	O
special	O
than	O
everybody	O
else	O
I	O
completely	O
agree	O
that	O
parents	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
.	O
Children	B-ARG
normally	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
somehow	I-ARG
special	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
children’s	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
the	B-ARG
things	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
say	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
power	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
.	O
More	B-ARG
power	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	B-ARG
someone	I-ARG
tells	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
kid	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
something	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
wrong	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
shouldn't	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
it,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
father	I-ARG
told	I-ARG
him/her	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
right,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
kid	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
listen	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
father	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
person,	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
father	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
wrong	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
a	B-ARG
child	I-ARG
normally	I-ARG
spends	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
so	O
their	B-ARG
parents	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
him/her	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
anybody	I-ARG
else	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
contact	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
intimacy	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
.	O
Lastly,	O
children	B-ARG
usually	I-ARG
mirror	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
That’s	O
as	O
important	O
thing	O
because	O
even	B-ARG
if	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
don’t	I-ARG
intend	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
something,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
observing	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
if	B-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
man	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
beats	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
wife	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
treats	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
bad,	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
probably	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
rude	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
treat	I-ARG
girls	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
.	O
All	O
in	O
all,	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
parents	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
greatest	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
and	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
very	O
careful	O
with	O
what	O
they	O
say	O
and	O
do	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
their	O
child,	O
because	O
it	O
can	O
define	O
who	O
he	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
.	O

Easy	O
preparation	O
of	O
food	O
leads	O
to	O
a	O
better	O
life	O
The	O
Technology	O
has	O
developed	O
a	O
lot	O
.	O
With	O
that	O
development,	O
food	O
can	O
be	O
prepared	O
more	O
easily	O
and	O
it	O
can	O
taste	O
a	O
lot	O
better	O
than	O
it	O
used	O
to	O
.	O
With	O
that	O
change,	O
people’s	O
lives	O
are	O
a	O
lot	O
better	O
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
Some	O
good	O
reasons	O
are	O
about	O
having	O
more	O
time	O
and	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
prepare	O
better	O
food	O
without	O
being	O
a	O
good	O
cook	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
people	B-ARG
normally	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
lots	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
.	O
Because	O
of	O
that,	O
they	B-ARG
don’t	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
kitchen	I-ARG
.	O
But	O
being	B-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
tasty	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
putting	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
microwave	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
oven	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
awesome	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	B-ARG
an	I-ARG
engineer	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
project,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
deliver	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
tomorrow,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
save	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG
preparing	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
microwave	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
cooking	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
scratch	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
when	B-ARG
someone	I-ARG
wants	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
reason,	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
ago	I-ARG
he/she	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
cook	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG

nowadays	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

tasty	I-ARG
food	I-ARG

wants	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
dinner	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
girlfriend,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
buy	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
comes	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
instructions	I-ARG
.	O
Normally	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
oven	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
wait	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
All	O
in	O
all,	O
that	O
ease	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
improved	I-ARG
people’s	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG

that	O
happened	O
mainly	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
development	O

But	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
careful	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
eat,	I-ARG
because	O
some	B-ARG
industrial	I-ARG
foods	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

they	B-ARG

think	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
along	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

only	I-ARG
one	I-ARG

University	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
making	I-ARG

the	B-ARG
issue	I-ARG

become	I-ARG
crucial	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

In	B-ARG
today’s	I-ARG

two	I-ARG

at	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
time	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

The	B-ARG

a	B-ARG

should	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG

for	O
a	O

reasons	O

A	B-ARG
professor	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
researcher	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
expert	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
specific	I-ARG
science	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG

He	B-ARG
or	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
passion	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
field	I-ARG
so	O
that	O
he	B-ARG
or	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
push	I-ARG
him/herself	I-ARG

all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

And	O
then	O
he	B-ARG

she	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

works	I-ARG

For	O

the	B-ARG
most	I-ARG
impressive	I-ARG

my	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG

Mr	I-ARG

He	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
one	I-ARG

gave	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
inspiration	I-ARG

taught	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG

more	I-ARG
efficient	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
ourselves	I-ARG

If	B-ARG
a	I-ARG

doesn't	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
researching	I-ARG

give	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG

In	O

a	B-ARG
professor	I-ARG

her	I-ARG
research	I-ARG

conclusion,	O
a	B-ARG

some	O

I	O

living	B-ARG

more	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
.	O
Admittedly,	O
job	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
us	I-ARG

People	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
receive	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sense	I-ARG

respected	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
receive	I-ARG
respect	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
others,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
achievement	I-ARG

self-confidence	I-ARG

In	O
addition,	O
job	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
us	I-ARG

However,	O
people	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
concern	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
for	B-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
us,	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
tool	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
maintain	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
.	O
Few	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
happiness	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
continue	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
30	I-ARG
years	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
Workers	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
FOXCONN	I-ARG
factory,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
manufacture	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
APPLE	I-ARG
Company,	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
repeat	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
action	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
8	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
labor	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
workers	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
happiness	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
feel	I-ARG
tired	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
frustrated	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
hour	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
beautiful	B-ARG
environment	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG
physiological	I-ARG
needs,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
fundamental	I-ARG
requirements	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG

Without	B-ARG
beautiful	I-ARG
environment,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG

not	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
happiness	I-ARG

fell	I-ARG
anxiety	I-ARG

Nowadays,	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
fast	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
economy	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
gradually	I-ARG

our	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
quickly	I-ARG

Factories	B-ARG
released	I-ARG

In	B-ARG

people	I-ARG
destroy	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG

In	B-ARG
China,	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
residents	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
nearby	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
toxic	I-ARG
factories	I-ARG
became	I-ARG
sick	I-ARG

an	I-ARG

number	I-ARG

provided	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
those	I-ARG

they	B-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
happiness	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
high-paying	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
yet	O

them	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG

better	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

However,	O
from	O
my	O
point	O

view,	O
television	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
conversation	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
begin	O
with,	O
television	B-ARG
shows	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
forget	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
.	O
One	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
favorite	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
tends	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
obessed	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
air	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
they	B-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
appointment	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
since	O
they	B-ARG
think	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
crucial	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
.	O
One	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
friends,	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
example,	I-ARG
once	I-ARG
cancelled	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
appointment	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
basketball	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
favorite	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
"Infinete	I-ARG
Challenges"	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
basketball,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
friendship,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
depends	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
talk	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
.	O
That	O
is,	O
watching	B-ARG
television	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home,	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
lost	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
cohesion	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
even	B-ARG
when	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
together,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
conversation	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
front	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
television	I-ARG

Watching	B-ARG
television	I-ARG
program	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
program	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
sense	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
closeness	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
illustrate	O
my	O
point,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
reported	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
converse	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
behave	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
because	O
television	B-ARG
shows	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
require	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
participation	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
firmly	O
believe	O
that	O
it	B-ARG

detrimental	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
stare	I-ARG
forward	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
obsessed	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
it	I-ARG

Haste	O

This	O
saying	O
is	O
stating	O
that	O
every	B-ARG
fast	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
thought	I-ARG
decision	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
wasted	I-ARG
one	I-ARG

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
this	O
statement	O
is	O
completely	O
true,	O
for	O
these	O
few	O
reasons:	O
For	O
one	O
thing,	O
making	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
quick	I-ARG
decision	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it's	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
thought	I-ARG
out,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
hasn't	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
checked	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
aspects	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
making	B-ARG
quick	I-ARG
decisions	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
probable	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
results	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example:	O
if	B-ARG
someone	I-ARG
decided	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
quit	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
thinking	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
alternative,	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
plan	I-ARG
B,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
unemployed,	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
speedy	I-ARG
decision	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
making	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
rushed	I-ARG
decision	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
mean	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
missing	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
another	O
word,	O
if	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
waited	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
thought	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
decision	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
wouldn't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
missed	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
opening	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
firm,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
position	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
he	B-ARG
wouldn't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
unemployed	I-ARG
.	O
Not	O
to	O
mention,	O
that	O
hasty	B-ARG
decisions,	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
goes	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
waste,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also,	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
affect	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
entire	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
.	O
To	B-ARG
put	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
differently,	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
quit	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
became	I-ARG
unemployed,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
bills	I-ARG
nor	I-ARG
buy	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
everyday	I-ARG
needs,	I-ARG
thus,	O
his	B-ARG

a	I-ARG
turn	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
worst	I-ARG

As	O
can	O

from	O
this,	O

that	O
a	B-ARG
hurried	I-ARG
decision	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
almost	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
one	I-ARG

That's	O
why	O
one	O

Generally	O

the	O

that	O
cars	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
improved	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
people	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
overcome	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
distances	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
short	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
numerous	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example	O
in	O
relationships	O
.	O
Many	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
maintain	I-ARG
relationships	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
distances	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
visit	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
regularly	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
vehicle	I-ARG
.	O
From	O
my	O
personal	O
experience	O
I	O
recall	O
that	O
my	B-ARG
car	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
childhood	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
although	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
lived	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
was	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
establish	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
relationship	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
man	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
89	I-ARG
kilometers	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
.	O
Thanks	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
car	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
weekends	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
couple	I-ARG
today	I-ARG
.	O
Without	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
automobile	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
probably	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
relationship	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
cars	B-ARG
increase	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
employment	I-ARG
because	O
people	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
drive	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
further	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
flexible	I-ARG
.	O
My	B-ARG
father	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
example	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
Germany	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
earned	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
used	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
car	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
drive	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
country,	I-ARG
worked	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
week	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
came	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
weekend	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
he	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
car,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
wouldn't	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
weekends	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
automobile	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
-	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
terms	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
the	B-ARG
automobile	I-ARG
allows	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
travel	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
thus	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
cars	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
stay	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
hometown	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
village	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
mainly	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transport	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
thus	I-ARG
limited	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
accessing	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
places	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
nearly	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
reached	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
visited	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
car	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
people	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
vehicle	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
greater	I-ARG
access	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
places	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
the	O
above	O
stated	O
reasons	O
clearly	O
outweigh	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
cars	B-ARG
cause	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
provide	I-ARG
flexibility,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
nearly	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Travelling,	B-ARG
social	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
employment	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
highly	I-ARG
dependent	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
flexibility	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
nothing	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
flexible	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
own	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

that	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O
as	O
parents	O

in	O
the	O

they	B-ARG
could	I-ARG

support	I-ARG

their	I-ARG

such	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
my	B-ARG
father	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
software	I-ARG
programmer,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
indeed	I-ARG
teaches	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
programming	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
computer	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
.	O
Whenever	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
met	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
difficulty,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
reach	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
consulting	I-ARG
.	O
Because	O
he	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
experiences,	I-ARG
I	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
save	I-ARG
enormous	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
finding	I-ARG
solution	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
truly	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
competitive	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
colleagues	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
worked	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
field	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
father,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
faced	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
difficulty	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
.	O
Nevertheless,	O
since	O
parents	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
worked	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
tens	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

they	B-ARG

accumulated	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
rich	I-ARG

They	B-ARG

a	I-ARG

It	B-ARG

Watching	B-ARG
TV	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
homework	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
major	I-ARG
headaches	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
brought	I-ARG

I,	O
in	O
my	O
childhood,	O

just	O
a	O

case	O

Whenever	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
back	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
turning	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
television	I-ARG

sit	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG

I	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
hours,	I-ARG

I	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
hardly	I-ARG
sit	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
front	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
desk	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
homework	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
few	I-ARG
minutes	I-ARG

I	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
memorize	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
channels	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG

was	I-ARG
playing,	I-ARG

I	I-ARG

barely	I-ARG
memorize	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
word	I-ARG

I,	B-ARG
therefore,	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
extremely	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
sometimes	B-ARG
programs	I-ARG

violence	I-ARG

judgment	I-ARG

more	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

I	O

this	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O
a	B-ARG
worker's	I-ARG

his/her	I-ARG
competence	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
those	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
are	I-ARG

As	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
competent	I-ARG

we	I-ARG
must	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
ourselves	I-ARG

great	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG

as	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

It's	B-ARG
all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG

every	I-ARG
profession	I-ARG

That's	O
why	O
the	B-ARG

Second,	O
such	B-ARG
high	I-ARG
salaries	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

how	I-ARG

difficulties	I-ARG

how	I-ARG

In	O
other	O
words,	O
if	B-ARG

Some	O

the	B-ARG
gap	I-ARG

so	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
seems	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
unfair	I-ARG

However,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
as	B-ARG
long	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
equal	I-ARG
chances	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pursue	I-ARG
his/her	I-ARG

careers,	I-ARG
that	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
fair	I-ARG

Fairness	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
equal	I-ARG
payments	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
everyone,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
equal	I-ARG
chances	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
acquire	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

goal	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
accomplishment	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
high	B-ARG
salary	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
athletes	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
deserve	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
accordance	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
achievements	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
guarantee	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
performances	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
positive	I-ARG
encouragement	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG

People	O
who	O

Therefore,	O
here	O

the	O
point	O
that	O
people	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
can't	I-ARG
accept	I-ARG
others'	I-ARG
criticism	I-ARG
can't	I-ARG
succeed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
.	O
Personally,	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
this	O
statement	O
.	O
First,	O
the	B-ARG
core	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
"consensus"	I-ARG
.	O
It's	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
everyone’s	I-ARG
opinion	I-ARG
accounts	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
group	I-ARG
works,	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
members	I-ARG
gather	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
brain-storming	I-ARG
discussion,	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
possible	I-ARG
solutions	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
finally	I-ARG
reach	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
agreement	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
this	O
long	O
process	O
of	O
discussion,	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
different	O
opinions	O
sparkling	O
out	O
.	O
It	B-ARG
doesn't	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
member	I-ARG
solely	I-ARG
insists	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
his/her	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
doesn't	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
member's	I-ARG
criticism	I-ARG
because	O
the	B-ARG
work	I-ARG
belongs	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
member,	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
specific	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
member	I-ARG
.	O
It's	B-ARG
every	I-ARG
member's	I-ARG
duty	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
respect	I-ARG
other's	I-ARG
opinion	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
taking	B-ARG
criticism	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
virtue	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
someone's	I-ARG
opinion	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
against	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
.	O
Even	B-ARG
if	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
group,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
others'	I-ARG
criticism	I-ARG
.	O
Criticism	B-ARG
definitely	I-ARG
hurts	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
points	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
drawbacks	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
forces	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
confront	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
criticism	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
detect	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
drawbacks	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
fix	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
willing	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
Those	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
word	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
criticism	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
eventually	I-ARG
lose	I-ARG
chances	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
improved	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
if	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
can't	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
criticism,	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
fail	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
cooperating	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
defeated	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
one	I-ARG
Chinese	I-ARG
idiom	I-ARG
goes:	I-ARG
"The	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
medicine	I-ARG
tastes	I-ARG
bitter“	I-ARG
.	O
Criticism	B-ARG
might	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
powerful	I-ARG
solution	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
heal	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
some	O
people	O
might	O
ask:	O
what	O
if	O
the	O
criticism	O
proves	O
to	O
be	O
wrong?	O
What	O
if	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
right	O
but	O
the	O
seemingly	O
reasonable	O
criticism	O
led	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
wrong	O
direction?	O
Doesn't	O
insistence	O
also	O
a	O
good	O
character?	O
In	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
even	B-ARG
if	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
right,	I-ARG
criticism	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
helpful	I-ARG
because	O
in	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
case	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
fixer,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
serves	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
practice	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
test	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
Taking	B-ARG
criticism	I-ARG
doesn't	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
mean	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
.	O
You	O
should	O
have	O
your	O
own	O
judgments	O
too!	O
And	B-ARG
it's	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
criticism	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
criticism	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
especially	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
occasions	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
criticism	I-ARG
.	O
It's	O
just	O
like	O
a	O
picky	O
mirror	O
through	O
which	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
the	O
bad	O

explain	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG

help	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
apply	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
outside	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
by	B-ARG
explaining	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG
contributes	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
vivid	I-ARG
impression	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG
thus	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
interested	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
active	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
acquiring	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG
.	O
Take	B-ARG
chemistry	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
example,	I-ARG
merely	I-ARG
memorizing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
names	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
substances	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
structural	I-ARG
formulas	I-ARG
seems	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
boring,	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
representing	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
chemical	I-ARG
reactions	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
happen	I-ARG
near	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
raise	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
curiosity	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
digest	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
theories	I-ARG
learned	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
.	O
While	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
senior	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
school,	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
chemical	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
once	I-ARG
showed	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
detergent	I-ARG
dissolves	I-ARG
oil	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
experiment	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
later	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
taught	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
describe	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
process	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
formal	I-ARG
structural	I-ARG
formulas	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
type	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
method	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
fun	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
eventually	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
results	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
connected	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
visual	I-ARG
images	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
experiment	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
formula	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
barely	I-ARG
forget,	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
though	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
I'm	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
chemistry	I-ARG
anymore	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
by	B-ARG
bridging	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
theories	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
events,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
given	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
apply	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
ability	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
problem-solving	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
address	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
interests	I-ARG
because	O
it's	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
assignment	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
participation	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	B-ARG
law	I-ARG
class,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
informed	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
rights	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
duties	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
taught	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
apply	I-ARG
law	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
situations	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
happen	I-ARG
upon	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
any	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
situations	I-ARG
occurs,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
independently	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
figure	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
react	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
using	B-ARG
life	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
examples	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
demonstrate	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
effective	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
attract	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
eager	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
learning,	I-ARG
not	O
only	O
because	O
it	B-ARG
reinforces	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
impression	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
invites	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
practice	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG

Environmental	O

Economic	O

Environmental	O
protection	O
and	O
economic	O
developments	O
might	O
be	O
the	O
biggest	O
issues	O
in	O
the	O
21st	O
century	O
.	O
They	O
are	O
both	O
important	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
vital	O
to	O
human's	O

However,	O
since	O
the	O

governments	O
must	O
choose	O
between	O
these	O
two	O
issues	O

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
tackling	B-ARG
down	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
priority	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
developments	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
following	O
are	O
reasons	O
why	O
.	O
First,	O
environmental	B-ARG
protection	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
far	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
urgent	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
developments	I-ARG
.	O
All	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
creatures	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
mother	I-ARG
Earth	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
.	O
Without	B-ARG
Earth,	I-ARG
whatever	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
civil	I-ARG
constructions	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
achievements	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
vain	I-ARG
because	O
we	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
perish	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
she's	I-ARG
gone	I-ARG
.	O
Just	B-ARG
like	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
man	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
body,	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
creatures	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
strong	I-ARG
planet	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
the	B-ARG
influence	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
boarder	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
profound	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
issues	I-ARG
.	O
Environmental	B-ARG
problems	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
global	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
local,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
spared	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
.	O
Take	B-ARG
global	I-ARG
warming	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
example,	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
temperature	I-ARG
increases,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
globe	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
affected,	I-ARG
suffering	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
hotter	I-ARG
weather	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
melting	I-ARG
ice	I-ARG
mountain	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
jeopardizes	I-ARG
habitats	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
polar	I-ARG
region,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rising	I-ARG
sea	I-ARG
level	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
endangers	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
residents	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
island	I-ARG
near	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
equator,	I-ARG
since	O
the	B-ARG
rising	I-ARG
sea	I-ARG
water	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
drown	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
Environmental	B-ARG
issues	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
divided	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
nationality	I-ARG
because	O
all	B-ARG
humans	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
simply	I-ARG
entwined	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
home-Earth	I-ARG
.	O
Some	O
people	O
might	O
argue	O
that	O
economic	B-ARG
issues	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
global	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
critical	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
thus	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
aside	I-ARG
.	O
They	O
may	O
say	O
that	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
situation,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
revolt	I-ARG
instantly,	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
seem	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
chronic	I-ARG
diseases	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
burst	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
the	B-ARG
truth	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
we've	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
encountering	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
sighs	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
warnings	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
global	I-ARG
climate	I-ARG
anomalies	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
crisis	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
unwise	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
deny	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
truth	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
focusing	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
developments	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
unfortunately,	I-ARG
usually	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
developments	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
causes	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
damages	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
environmental	B-ARG
conservation	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
developments	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
aspects	I-ARG

University	O

In	O

much	O
independence	O
in	O
the	O

These	O

to	O
attend	O
the	O

as	O

as	O
they	O

pass	O

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
students	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
matter	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
outcome	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
in	B-ARG
terms	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
learning,	I-ARG
attending	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
effective	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
simply	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pass	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
exams	I-ARG
.	O
Classes	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
designed	I-ARG
diligently	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
absolutely	I-ARG
bear	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
Professors	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
knowledge,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
equip	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
experiences,	I-ARG
knowing	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
guide	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
toward	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
achievements	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
it's	B-ARG
students'	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
.	O
Attending	B-ARG
class	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
persuasive	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
respect	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
professor	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
.	O
Many	B-ARG
professors	I-ARG
grade	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
attendances	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
class	B-ARG
attendances	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
regarded	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
critical	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
examination	I-ARG
performances	I-ARG
.	O
Those	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
scores	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
exams	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
fail	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
didn't	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
.	O
Some	O
people	O
might	O
argue	O
that	O
if	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
already	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
contents	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pass	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
exams	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
.	O
Why	O
wasting	O
time	O
going	O
to	O
classes?	O
Doesn't	O
self-study	O
more	O
efficient?	O
However,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
this	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
immodest	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
thinking	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
professors	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
qualifications	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
.	O
Besides,	O
even	B-ARG
if	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
believe	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
brilliant	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
surpass	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
professors,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
discuss	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
classmates	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
students	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
thoroughly	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
showing	I-ARG
respect	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
attending	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG

It's	B-ARG
an	I-ARG

game	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
said	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
penalty-kick	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
.	O
Statically	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
fifty-fifty	I-ARG
.	O
But	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
Ronaldo	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
penalty-kick	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
possibility	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
Ronaldo	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
fortune	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
.	O
Definitely	B-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
practice	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
exercise	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
exercise	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
football	I-ARG
field	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
day,	I-ARG
so	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
luckier	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
we	B-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
lean	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
luck	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
successful	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
don't	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
disavow	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
luck	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
success,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
hardly	I-ARG
accompany	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
for	O
example	O
you	B-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
TOEFL	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
multiple-choice	I-ARG
test	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
four	I-ARG
option	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
question	I-ARG
.	O
You	B-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
Rely	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
luck,	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
lucky	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
pick	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
fail	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
.	O
Undoubtedly	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
wise	I-ARG
advice	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
you	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
project	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
most	I-ARG
fortunate	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
word	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
manufacture	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
automobile	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
tower	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
plans	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
done	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
mastered	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
his/her	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
Undoubtedly	O
such	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
the	O
end,	O
I	O
think	O
any	B-ARG
great	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
luck,	I-ARG
even	O
though	O
luck	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
factor	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
reaching	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
but	O
its	B-ARG
impact	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
extraneous	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
must	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
reckon	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
luck	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
plans	I-ARG
.	O

Sometimes	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
Different	O
people	O
prefer	O
different	O
styles	O
of	O
learning	O
.	O
I	O
think	O
both	B-ARG
learning	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
myself	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
helpful	I-ARG
.	O
Learning	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
confused	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rate	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
speed	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
.	O
Another	O
important	O
point	O
is	O
that	O
for	B-ARG
practical	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
sometimes	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
.	O
A	B-ARG
good	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
experienced	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
faster	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
.	O
Sometimes	B-ARG
when	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
myself	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
confusing	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
few	I-ARG
sources	I-ARG
available,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
discouraged	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
spending	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
situation,	I-ARG
I'll	I-ARG
look	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
request	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
.	O
And	B-ARG
then	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
efficiently	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
short	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	O
therefore	O
I	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
faster	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
won't	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
discouraged	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
confused	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
practical	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
instructor	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
driving	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
car	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
medicine	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
engineering	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
skiing	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
swimming,	I-ARG
you'll	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
.	O
It's	B-ARG
almost	I-ARG
impossible	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
inefficient	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
.	O
By	O
the	O
way,	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
learn	O
some	O
things	O
by	O
yourself,	O
you	O
may	O
learn	O

understand	O
them	O
incorrectly!	O
For	O
example,	O
from	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
experiences,	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
started	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
guitar	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
got	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
wrong	I-ARG
habits	I-ARG
regarding	I-ARG
strumming	I-ARG

tempo,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
finding	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
tutor	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
identifying	I-ARG

eliminating	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
incorrect	I-ARG
habits,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
properly	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
because	O
I	B-ARG
won't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
extra	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
wasted	I-ARG
either	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
today's	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
useful	I-ARG
sources	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
books,	I-ARG
electronic	I-ARG
books,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
internet	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
satellite	I-ARG

I	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
utilize	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
tutorials	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
things	I-ARG

For	O

I	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
English	I-ARG

by	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG

many	I-ARG
online	I-ARG
websites	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
sum,	O
sometimes	O
it	O
is	O
good	O
to	O
learn	O
with	O
a	O
teacher	O
and	O
sometimes	O
on	O
my	O
own	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
view,	O
both	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG

Once	O
you	O
are	O
unique	O
enough,	O
you	O
are	O
already	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
success	O
Achieving	O
success	O
is	O
everybody's	O
goal	O
for	O
life	O

there	O
are	O
absolutely	O
many	O
different	O
directions	O
that	O

lead	O
people	O

success	O

Some	O
people	O
choose	O
to	O
be	O
normal	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
chances,	O
while	O
some	O
other	O
people	O
prefer	O
to	O

different	O
from	O
everyone	O
else	O

Which	O
one	O
is	O
the	O
promising	O
way	O
to	O
succeed?	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
once	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
unique	I-ARG
enough,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
already	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
being	B-ARG
positively	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
else	I-ARG
usually	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
you've	I-ARG
achieved	I-ARG
something	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
superior	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
competent	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
survival	I-ARG
game	I-ARG
.	O
Only	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
sharpest	I-ARG
weapon	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
survive	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
yourself	I-ARG
outstanding	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
fail	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
distinguish	I-ARG
yourself	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
others,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
replaced	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
eliminated	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
.	O
Take	O
myself	O
for	O
example,	O
when	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
college,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
chosen	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
presenter	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
report	I-ARG
because	O
I	B-ARG
was	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
present	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
report	I-ARG
thoroughly	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
fluently	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
being	B-ARG
unique	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
value	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
once	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
special	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
unique,	I-ARG
pursuing	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
matter	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
actively	I-ARG
creating	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fashion	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
passively	I-ARG
waiting	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
recognize	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
appreciate	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
.	O
Take	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
popular	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
prestigious	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
company-	I-ARG
Apple-	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
example	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
reason	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
gains	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
tremendous	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
achieves	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
brilliant	I-ARG
qualities	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
caught	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
competitors	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
operating	I-ARG
systems	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
run	I-ARG
smoother	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
design	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
wins	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
popularity	I-ARG
among	I-ARG
consumers	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
uniqueness	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
Apple	I-ARG
design	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
creates	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
value	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
being	B-ARG
different	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
unique	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
shows	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
competence	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
creates	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
value,	I-ARG
making	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
towards	I-ARG
success	I-ARG

of	O
all,	O

It	B-ARG

of	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
symbols	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG
.	O
Under	O
this	O
circumstance,	O
learning	B-ARG
art	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
enables	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
appreciate	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fruits	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
eminent	I-ARG
artists	I-ARG

musicians	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fascination	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
students	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
greatest	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
masterpiece	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
Euopren	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
symphony	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
destiny-Beethoven's	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
notable	I-ARG
workpiece	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
played	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
studying	B-ARG
art	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
appropriate	I-ARG
outlets	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
superb	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
relax	I-ARG
.	O
Obviously,	O
with	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
improvement	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
rhythm,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
currently	I-ARG
suffered	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
jobs,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
destroy	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
emancipate	I-ARG
himself	I-ARG
.	O
Art	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
are,	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
accessible	I-ARG
tools	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
liberate	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
extremely	I-ARG
stressful	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
enjoying	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
piece	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
brilliant	I-ARG
paintings,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Mona	I-ARG
Lisa,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
down	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ground	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
proficient	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
mysterious	I-ARG
smile	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
stands	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
.	O
At	O
this	O
moment,	O
they	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
totally	I-ARG
involve	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ocean	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
stressful	I-ARG
nervous	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
relieved	I-ARG
.	O
Apparently,	O
this	B-ARG
sense	I-ARG
towards	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
built	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
initial	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
.	O
Admittedly,	O
the	B-ARG
study	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
supposed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
rely	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
younger	I-ARG
student's	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
interest	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
education	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
resist	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
the	B-ARG
school	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
replace	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG
science	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
cultivate	I-ARG
student's	I-ARG
interest	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
adding	I-ARG
extra	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
a	O
nutshell,	O
in	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
society,	I-ARG
since	I-ARG
understanding	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lengthen	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
depth	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
meanwhile	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
burdened	I-ARG
excessive	I-ARG
pressure,	I-ARG
younger	B-ARG
students'	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
second	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
.	O

Challenges	O
are	O
different	O
from	O
generation	O
to	O
generation	O
While	O
debating	O
about	O
generation	O
issues,	O
people	O
always	O
have	O
different	O
opinions	O
.	O
Some	O
people	O
believe	O
that	O
little	O
things	O
changed	O
through	O
generation,	O
while	O
others	O
claim	O
that	O
generation	O
differences	O
are	O
presented	O
in	O
every	O
way	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
every	B-ARG
prospective	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
generations	I-ARG
alters	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
especially	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
challenges	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
generation	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
significantly	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
last	I-ARG
generation	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
under	B-ARG
globalization	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
industrial	I-ARG
integration,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
work-related	I-ARG
challenges	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
generation	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
complicated	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
challenging	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
successful	O
people	O
are	O
those	O
who	O
can	O
quickly	O
respond	O
to	O
this	O
rapid-changing	O
world	O
.	O
In	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
past,	I-ARG
focusing	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
skill	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
because	O
every	B-ARG
industry	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
size	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
simple	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
manage	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
as	B-ARG
those	I-ARG
industries	I-ARG
expand	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
internationalized,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
required	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
equip	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
multiple	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
answer	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
challenges	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
now	B-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
chances	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG
so	O
besides	B-ARG
one's	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
profession,	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
ability	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
another	O
example,	O
financial	B-ARG
crimes	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
rampant	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
21st	I-ARG
century,	I-ARG
thus	O
surging	B-ARG
up	I-ARG
demands	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
excel	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
laws	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
management	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
this	B-ARG
generation	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
encountering	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
self-recognition	I-ARG
issue	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
experienced	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
previous	I-ARG
generation	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
past	I-ARG
generation	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
given	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
freedom	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
usually	I-ARG
asked	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
follow	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
paths	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
prepared	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
contrast,	O
young	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
generation	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
exposed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
creative	I-ARG
ideas	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
individually	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
eager	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
finding	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
fortunate	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
struggle	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
sweet	I-ARG
worries	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
worries	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
indeed	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
decisions	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
possibilities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
responsible	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
consequences	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
challenges	B-ARG
for	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
generation	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
complicated	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
diverse	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
past	I-ARG
generation,	I-ARG
whether	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
self-identification	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
hard	O
to	O
judge	O
which	O
generation's	O
problems	O
are	O
more	O
difficult	O
but	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
doubt	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
until	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
next	I-ARG
generation,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
challenges	I-ARG
waiting	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
next	I-ARG
youngsters	I-ARG
.	O

I	O
am	O
concerned,	O
having	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
scale	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
key	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
following	O
will	O

my	O
points	O

First	O
of	O
all,	O
when	B-ARG
one	I-ARG
knows	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
region's	I-ARG
works,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
I	O
worked	O
in	O
a	O
large	O
company,	O
which	O
has	O
many	O
different	O
departments	O
.	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
Management	O
Information	O
System	O
department	O

What	O
we	O
do	O
every	O
day	O
is	O
to	O
solve	O
the	O
problem	O
that	O
our	O
clients	O
asked	O
in	O
the	O
phone	O
.	O
While	B-ARG
some	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Engineering	I-ARG
department's	I-ARG
part,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
went	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
discussed	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
colleagues	I-ARG
there,	I-ARG
since	O
I	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
studied	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
engineering	I-ARG
courses	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
contact	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
department,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
popular	I-ARG
there,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
when	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
translate	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
major,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
about	I-ARG

Jeff's	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG

my	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
main	O

that	O
successful	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
important	I-ARG

very	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
points	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
trying	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
things	I-ARG

The	O
other	O
reason	O

that	O
great	B-ARG
success	I-ARG
requires	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
risks	I-ARG

There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG

interesting	I-ARG

useful	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG

learn	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
by	I-ARG

new	I-ARG
things	I-ARG

if	B-ARG
you	I-ARG

know	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
act	I-ARG
effectively	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
communicating	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
something	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
salesmanship	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
stores	I-ARG

spend	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

time	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
television,	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
eat	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
television,	I-ARG

all,	O
some	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG

time	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
.	O
Instead	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
family	I-ARG

friends,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
seat	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
chair	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG

I	B-ARG
know	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
wakes	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
morning	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
eat	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
turns	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
on,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
records	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

he	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG

Sometimes	B-ARG
his	I-ARG

wants	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
talk	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
let	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
talk	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
commercials	I-ARG

So,	O
she	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
used	I-ARG

his	I-ARG
habit	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
prefers	I-ARG

write	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
an	I-ARG

Time	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

gold,	I-ARG
some	I-ARG

take	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
talk	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
them	I-ARG

Another	B-ARG
way	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
destroyed	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
seat	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
table	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
dinner	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
family	I-ARG

This	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
children,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
share	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
school,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
project	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
concerns	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
when	B-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
dinner	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
friends,	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
fluid	I-ARG
conversation	I-ARG
because	O
the	B-ARG
television	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
again	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
them	I-ARG

When	B-ARG
family	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
gather	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
eating	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
talking,	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
reality	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
cases	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
some	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
priority	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
remember	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
told	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
telenovela	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
house	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
night	I-ARG
.	O
Honestly,	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
shock!	O
How	O
she	O
could	O
say	O
that	O
to	O
me?	O
.	O
As	O
I	O
have	O
said,	O
television	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
tool	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn,	I-ARG
entertain	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
inform	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
happening,	I-ARG
but	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
television	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
destroyed	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
among	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
soon	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
priority,	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
eat	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
front	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
television	I-ARG

Spending	O
equal	O
amount	O
of	O
money	O
on	O
libraries	O
and	O
sports?	O
University	O
students	O
can	O
be	O
divided	O
into	O
two	O
groups,	O
one	O
group	O
with	O
less	O
interest	O
to	O
study	O

the	O

which	O

Usually	O
the	O

We	O

30	O
minutes	O
form	O
the	O
basis	O
of	O
the	O
healthy	O

life	O
.	O
But	O
I	B-ARG
don't	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
equal	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
spent	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
issues	I-ARG

libraries	I-ARG

laboratories	I-ARG

physical	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
in	O
my	O
view	O
spending	B-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
equipping	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
gyms	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
constructing	I-ARG
football/basketball	I-ARG
courts	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
my	B-ARG
roommate,	I-ARG
Mary,	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
wakes	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
6	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
morning	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
spends	I-ARG
1	I-ARG
hour	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
sport	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
park	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
near	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
dormitory	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
she	I-ARG
gets	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
dorm,	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
full	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
shower,	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
ready	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
start	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
you	O
see,	O
she	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
exercise	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
spending	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
cent	I-ARG
.	O
What	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
informing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
sport	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
hanging	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
posters	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
campus,	I-ARG
inviting	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
athletes	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
lecture	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
them	I-ARG

spend	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
body	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
students	B-ARG
choose	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
major	I-ARG
based	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
interests	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
university	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
equipment	I-ARG
needed	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
Because	O
their	B-ARG
major	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
completely	I-ARG
involved	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG

In	O
contrast,	O
for	B-ARG
an	I-ARG
engineer	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
medicine	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
fair	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
equip	I-ARG
gyms	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
laboratories,	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
really	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
enthusiastic	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
innovative	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG

maybe	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
things	I-ARG

their	I-ARG
field	I-ARG

Finally,	O
spending	B-ARG
money	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
looks	I-ARG

wasting	I-ARG
money	I-ARG

For	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
want	I-ARG

want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
last	I-ARG

For	O

when	B-ARG
I	I-ARG

my	I-ARG

want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG

we	I-ARG
prefer	I-ARG

go	I-ARG
out	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
places	I-ARG

disturbed	I-ARG

In	O

I	B-ARG

the	I-ARG

I	O
think	O
both	B-ARG

as	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

complete	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

If	B-ARG
some	I-ARG

lack	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ability	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

In	O

those	B-ARG

perhaps	I-ARG

unable	I-ARG

these	I-ARG

Every	B-ARG

Finally,	O
some	O

that	O
the	B-ARG

Thus,	O
it	B-ARG

Nevertheless,	O
this	B-ARG

It	B-ARG

obviously	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
place,	I-ARG

then	I-ARG
stick	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

undoubtedly	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
powerful	I-ARG

that	O

In	B-ARG
this	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
whenever	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
.	O
Telephones	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
email	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
close	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
using	B-ARG
telephones	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
email	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
words	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
face-to-face	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instant,	O
sometime	B-ARG
when	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
argue	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
friends,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
self	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
moment	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
when	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
realize	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
happened,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
explain	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
thought	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
emotion	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
these	B-ARG
types	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
communications	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
.	O
Telephones	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
email	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
because	O
I	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
directly	I-ARG
connect	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
love	I-ARG
.	O
Beside,	O
I	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
thought	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
telephones	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
email	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
telephones	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
email	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG

Big	O

The	B-ARG

Where	B-ARG
a	I-ARG

up	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

People	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
big	I-ARG

many	I-ARG
options	I-ARG

people	I-ARG

one	I-ARG

one	I-ARG

In	B-ARG
big	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
educational	I-ARG

is	I-ARG

small	I-ARG

It’s	O

that	O
in	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG

education	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Better	B-ARG
education	I-ARG

So	O
persons	B-ARG
in	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG

get	I-ARG

But	O
by	B-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
sacrifices	I-ARG
quiet	I-ARG

peaceful	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
breathing	I-ARG
fresh	I-ARG

much	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
traffic	I-ARG

anyway	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
transportation,	I-ARG
because	O
distances	B-ARG

Every	B-ARG

I	I-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

their	I-ARG
disadvantages	I-ARG

living	I-ARG

In	O

completely	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

my	I-ARG

this	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
in	O
my	O
view	O
living	B-ARG

quite	I-ARG
funnier	I-ARG

better	I-ARG

more	I-ARG
exciting	I-ARG

living	I-ARG

Without	O

the	B-ARG

something	I-ARG

you	I-ARG

For	O

Albert	B-ARG
Einstein,	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
competent	I-ARG
physicians	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
history,	I-ARG
devoted	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
theory	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
physics	I-ARG

finally	I-ARG
established	I-ARG

Instead,	O
he	B-ARG
hardly	I-ARG
cared	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
something	I-ARG
else	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
said	I-ARG
that,	I-ARG
surprisingly,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
tried	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
distinguish	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
hand	I-ARG
soup	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
facial	I-ARG
soup	I-ARG
because,	O
at	O
least	O
for	O
him,	O
using	B-ARG
two	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
soups	I-ARG
properly	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
quite	I-ARG
annoying	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
the	O
example	O
above	O
indicates,	O
you	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
accomplish	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
purpose	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
concentrating	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
already	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
well,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
better	I-ARG

it	I-ARG

When	B-ARG
you're	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
something	I-ARG

you	I-ARG

feel	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
satisfied	I-ARG

more	I-ARG
interested	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
it	I-ARG

Then,	O
you	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
motivate	I-ARG
yourself	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
give	O
an	O
example,	O
I	B-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
math	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
junior	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
.	O
Because	O
I	B-ARG
was	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
satisfied	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fact	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
preferably,	I-ARG
I	B-ARG
became	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
absorb	I-ARG
myself	I-ARG

try	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
level	I-ARG

math	I-ARG

As	O
a	O

I	B-ARG
could	I-ARG

only	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
scores	I-ARG

math	I-ARG
test	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
solve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university-level	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG

Thus,	O
by	B-ARG
doing	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
you	I-ARG

In	O
summary,	O
doing	B-ARG
what	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
already	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG

do	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
much	I-ARG

First,	O
dancing	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
significant	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
something	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
believe	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
some	B-ARG
culture	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
believe	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
dance	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
sacrifice	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
god	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG

Or	B-ARG
some	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
arid	I-ARG
area	I-ARG
believe	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
if	I-ARG

Consequently,	O
dancing	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
belief	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
dancing	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
represent	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
civilization	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
seen	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
western	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
kingdom	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
visitor	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
kingdom,	I-ARG
king	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
queen	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
dance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
splendid	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
kingdom	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG

The	B-ARG

and	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
dance	I-ARG

All	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
civilization	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
.	O
Thirdly,	O
many	B-ARG
culture,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
entertain	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
.	O
And	O
dancing	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
.	O
Both	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
dance	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
time	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
many	B-ARG
event,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
christmas,	I-ARG
last	I-ARG
christmas	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
went	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
mall	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
buy	I-ARG
gifts,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
entertained	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
santa	I-ARG
custom	I-ARG
dancing	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
christmas	I-ARG
song	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
felt	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
santas	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
strongly	O
agree	O
with	O
notion	O
that	O
dancing	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
because	O
dancing	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
represent	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
believe	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG

Besides,	O
dancing	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
civilization	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
people	B-ARG
use	I-ARG
dancing	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
entertain	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG

So	O
dancing	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG

Sometimes,	B-ARG

the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
useful	I-ARG

Many	B-ARG

In	O
my	O
point	O

view,	O
studying	B-ARG
many	I-ARG

better	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
because	O
students	B-ARG

study	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
interested	I-ARG

they	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O
when	B-ARG

about	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG

This	O

because	O
they	B-ARG

For	O

Therefore,	O
in	O
my	O

I	O
accede	O

notion	O
that	O
government	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
as	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
after	B-ARG
great	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
recession,	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
unemployed	I-ARG
.	O
Then,	O
many	O
people	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
money	O
.	O
When	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
money,	I-ARG
They	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
rob	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
were	I-ARG
increasing	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
rate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
quality	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
dropping	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
unhappy	I-ARG
.	O
So	O
that,	O
government	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
invest	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
jobs,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
steal	I-ARG
money	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
criminal	B-ARG
rate	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
drop	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
people	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
environment	B-ARG

Nowaday,	O
industrial	B-ARG

So,	O
government	B-ARG
take	I-ARG
care	I-ARG

this	I-ARG

by	I-ARG
declare	I-ARG
regulate	I-ARG

carbon	I-ARG

In	O
addition	O
to	O
controlling	O
emission	O
carbon	O

government	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
invest	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
alternative	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
solar	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
coal	I-ARG
energy	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
lived	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
environment,	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
better	I-ARG

Lastly,	O
family	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
root	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
society	I-ARG

If	B-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
each	I-ARG

that	I-ARG

If	I-ARG

When	B-ARG

it	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
impact	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

Thus,	O
government	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
create	I-ARG

For	O

not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
much	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
personally	O
agree	O
with	O
statement	O
that	O

money	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG

The	O
basic	O
needs:	O

love	O

These	B-ARG
three	I-ARG
issues	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
opinion	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
on	I-ARG

improve	I-ARG

Best	O
ways	O
of	O
reducing	O
stress:	O
listening	O
to	O
music,	O
exercise,	O
meditation	O
Nowadays,	O
we	O
are	O
living	O
in	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
which	O
is	O
absolutely	O
complicated	O
.	O
Everything	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
rush,	O
and	O
it	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
competition	O
.	O
These	O
make	O
people	O
get	O
stress	O
.	O
Thus,	O
many	O
people	O
try	O
to	O
reduce	O
their	O
stress	O
.	O
There	O
are	O
many	O
activities	O
that	O
could	O
relieve	O
those	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
in	O
stress	O
.	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
reducing	B-ARG
stress	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
listening	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
music,	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
sports,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
meditation	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
practical	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
listening	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
relax	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
when	O
I	O
go	O
to	O
office,	O
I	O
use	O
public	O
transport	O
.	O
I	O
see	O
many	O
things	O
such	O
as	O
traffic	O
jam,	O
crowded	O
people	O
at	O
bus	O
stop,	O
and	O
all	O
so	O
crowded	O
people	O
in	O
buses	O
.	O
These	O
make	O
me	O
stress	O
.	O
So	O
that	O
I	B-ARG
always	I-ARG
listen	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
mp3	I-ARG
player	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
listening	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
thinking	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
I	B-ARG
feel	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
listen	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
another	B-ARG
way	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
perfectly	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
exercise	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	O
alway	O
have	O
many	O
things	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
such	O
as	O
a	O
difficult	O
of	O
my	O
work	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
finish	O
in	O
time	O
.	O
These	O
problem	O
sometime	O
make	O
me	O
hard	O
to	O
fall	O
asleep	O
because	O
it	O
make	O
me	O
stress	O
.	O
Thus,	O
after	B-ARG
work,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
exercise,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
jogging	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
favorite	I-ARG
sport	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
feel	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
out,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
am	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
fall	I-ARG
asleep	I-ARG
.	O
Exercising	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
Third,	O
meditation	B-ARG
also	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
.	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
many	O
things	O
to	O
think	O
about,	O
and	O
this	O
make	O
me	O
stress,	O
I	O
will	O
do	O
meditation	O
.	O
Meditation	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
relax	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
require	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
equipment,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
few	I-ARG
minutes	I-ARG
.	O
A	B-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
meditation	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
sit	I-ARG
down,	I-ARG
close	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
eyes,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
count	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
breath	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
relieve	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
ways	O
to	O
reduce	O
the	O
stress	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
listening	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
music,	I-ARG
exercising,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
meditation	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
escape	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
usable	I-ARG
.	O
And	B-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
physically	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
.	O

Should	O
teachers	O
be	O
paid	O
according	O
to	O
how	O
much	O
their	O
students	O
learn?	O
Everyone	O
is	O
different	O
.	O
Although	O
students	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
process	O
of	O
education	O
system,	O
learning	O
abilities	O
in	O
each	O
students	O
are	O
not	O
equal	O
.	O
Some	O
students	O
are	O
fast	O
learner,	O
but	O
some	O
students	O
are	O
not	O
.	O
Thus,	O
paying	B-ARG
for	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
base	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
grade	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
got	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
appropriate,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
fair	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
.	O
So	O
that,	O
I	O
disagree	O
with	O
this	O
notion	O
.	O
To	O
begin	O
with,	O
in	O
schools,	O
main	B-ARG
task	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
students,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
finish	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
period	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
these	I-ARG
short	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
possible	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
individual	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
.	O
Teachers	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
manage	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
topics	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
schedule	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
specific	I-ARG
students,	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
finish	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
miss	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
field	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
topics	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
learning	B-ARG
abilities	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
possible	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
comprehend	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
lessons	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
period	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
Some	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
topics	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
learnt	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
testing	B-ARG
result	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
problems	I-ARG
depend	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
fault	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
teachers	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
paid	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
testing	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
.	O
Lastly,	O
there	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
schools	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
grade	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
.	O
That	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
.	O
Teacher	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
topics	I-ARG
.	O
Teachers	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
grades	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
salary	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
problem	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
happened	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
grade	B-ARG
that	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
evaluating	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	B-ARG
totally	I-ARG
disagree	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
statement	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
paid	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
because	O
teacher	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
.	O
Besides,	O
learning	B-ARG
abilities	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
paying	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
grade	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
.	O

Should	O
good	O
people	O
are	O
rewarded	O
and	O
bad	O
people	O
are	O
punished	O
in	O
movies	O
or	O
dramas?	O
When	O
we	O
watch	O
movies	O
or	O
dramas,	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
like	O
to	O
see	O
good	O
people	O
have	O
a	O
good	O
ending	O
and	O
bad	O
people	O
are	O
punished	O
.	O
While	O
there	O
are	O
also	O
some	O
people	O
who	O
do	O
not	O
like	O
this	O
.	O
Personally,	O
I	O
prefer	O
to	O
see	O
good	O
people	O
get	O
rewarded	O
.	O
However,	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
ending,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
don’t	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
it’s	I-ARG
proper	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
if	B-ARG
all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
story	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
way,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
boring	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
good	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
win,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
guess	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ending	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
dramas	I-ARG
.	O
Then	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
interested	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
But	B-ARG
if	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
rewarded,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
finish	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
movie	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
dramas	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
story	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
Hollywood	B-ARG
stories	I-ARG
usually	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
ending	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
hero	I-ARG
beats	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
girl	I-ARG
.	O
But	B-ARG
now	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
including	I-ARG
me,	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
tired	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
don’t	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
ending	I-ARG
again	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
again	I-ARG
.	O
So	O
we	B-ARG
can’t	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
let	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
rewarded	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
.	O
Even	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
ending	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
.	O
And	O
I	O
think	O
it	B-ARG
happen	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
.	O
So	O
if	B-ARG
children	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
rewarded,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
true	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
misleading	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
.	O
And	O
they	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
act	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
reward	I-ARG
.	O
Once	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
rewarded,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
upset	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
person	I-ARG

But	O
in	O
fact,	O
the	B-ARG
good	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
matter	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ending	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
not	I-ARG

So	O
we	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
tell	I-ARG
this	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
avoid	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

In	O
fact,	O
those	B-ARG
good	I-ARG
endings	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
helpful	I-ARG
.	O
Some	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
encouraged	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
.	O
But	O
like	O
I	O
said,	O
this	B-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
won’t	I-ARG
last	I-ARG
long,	I-ARG
because	O
someday	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
realize	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
truth	I-ARG

So	O
I	O
suggest	O
we	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
truth	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
stories	I-ARG

And	O
if	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
can,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
matter	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
story	I-ARG
ends	I-ARG
.	O
Based	O
on	O
my	O
arguments	O
above,	O
I	O
think	O
movies	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
present	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
stories	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
reward	I-ARG

get	I-ARG
nothing	I-ARG

For	O

In	B-ARG

One	O

about	O

the	O

However,	O
it	O

In	O

almost	O
complete	O
public	O

for	O
one’s	O

transportation	O

So	O
the	B-ARG
thing	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
change	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
.	O
Since	O
I’m	B-ARG
facing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
traffic	I-ARG
congestion	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
.	O
And	O
this	O
problem	O
seem	O
to	O
get	O
worst	O
.	O
At	O
first,	O
it	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
alternatives	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
subway	I-ARG
train	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sky	I-ARG
train	I-ARG

Hence,	O
people	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
.	O
Since	O
now	B-ARG
buses	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
community,	I-ARG
It	B-ARG
makes	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
area	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
must	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bus	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
place	I-ARG

If	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
subway	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sky	I-ARG
train	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
here,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
convenience	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
people	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
estimate	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
subway	I-ARG
train	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
train	I-ARG
schedule	I-ARG
.	O
On	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
contrary	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
case	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bus	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
this	B-ARG
improvement	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
decrease	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
traffic	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
road	I-ARG
indirectly	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
the	B-ARG
buses	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
merely	I-ARG
two	I-ARG
routes	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
community	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
absolutely	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
major	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
intend	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
route	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
buses,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bus	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
destination	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
center	I-ARG
station	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
exchange	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
bus	I-ARG
.	O
Obviously,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
waste	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
routes	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
transport	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
.	O
Lastly,	O
having	B-ARG
more	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
dwindle	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
cars	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
it	O
provides	O
many	O
advantages	O

For	O

people	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
save	I-ARG

a	O
large	O
company	O
Companies	O

I	B-ARG
personally	I-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
First,	O
to	B-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
.	O
Large	B-ARG
companies	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
look	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
skilled	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
fill	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
distributing,	I-ARG
managing	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
selling	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
decides	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
open	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
branch	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
country,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
Large	B-ARG
company	I-ARG
equals	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
a	B-ARG
large	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
salaries	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
smaller	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
fact	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
one,	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it's	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
considerable	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
this	B-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
salaries	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
common	B-ARG
sense	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
tell	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
famous	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
known	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
won't	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
salary	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
small	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
.	O
Third,	O
I	O
love	O
travelling	O
around	O
the	O
world	O
.	O
large	B-ARG
companies	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
reputation,	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
organize	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
conferences,	I-ARG
meetings	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
workshops	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
travel	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

from	I-ARG
these	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O

I	B-ARG

I	B-ARG

all,	O

if	I-ARG

The	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O

take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG

On	O
the	O

that	O

study	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG

Of	O
course,	O
higher	B-ARG

take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG

First	O
and	O
foremost,	O
a	B-ARG
large	I-ARG
number	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

An	B-ARG
investigation	I-ARG
done	I-ARG

Beijing	I-ARG

that	I-ARG
80%	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

90%	I-ARG

computer	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
days	I-ARG

Recent	B-ARG
research	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
Scientist	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
reveals	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
youngs	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
attacted	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
lose	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
computer	I-ARG
games,	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
low	I-ARG
control	I-ARG
ability	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
children	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
nothing	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
computer	I-ARG
games,	I-ARG
therefore	O
time	B-ARG
on	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
activity	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
wasting	I-ARG
.	O
Since	O
all	B-ARG
these	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
developed	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
commercial	I-ARG
purpose	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
catch	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
eyes	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
children,	I-ARG
majority	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

use	I-ARG
war,	I-ARG

However,	O
those	B-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
suitable	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

bad	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Admittedly,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
few	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
paying	I-ARG
considerable	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

But	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
realize	O
the	O
fact:	O
majority	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

physical	I-ARG
exerice	I-ARG

these	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
uncommon	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
teenages	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
similar	I-ARG
experiment	I-ARG
done	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
scientist	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
reach	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
agreement	I-ARG
quickly	I-ARG

talk	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
work	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
indirectly	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
efficiency	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
project	I-ARG
because	O
there	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
conflicts	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
fight	I-ARG
amongst	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
team	I-ARG
members	I-ARG
.	O
Writing	B-ARG
an	I-ARG
email	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
informal	I-ARG
matter	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
matter	I-ARG
looks	I-ARG
official,	I-ARG
therefore	O
people	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
receives	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
email	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
nervous	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
maybe	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
offended	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
words	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
writing	I-ARG
.	O
While	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
words	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
expressed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
talking,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
counterparty	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
relaxed	I-ARG
since	O
their	B-ARG
response	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
recorded	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
misunderstand	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
informal	I-ARG
discussion	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
official	I-ARG
claim	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
less	B-ARG
misunderstanding	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
conflicts	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
fights,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
enhance	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
amongst	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
team	I-ARG
members	I-ARG
.	O
Admittedly,	O
sometimes	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
emails	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
team	I-ARG
members	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
located	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
place	I-ARG

Although	O
emails	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
convenient	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
none	I-ARG
.	O
Since	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
campus	I-ARG
projects,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
few	I-ARG
possibility	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
project	I-ARG
members	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
located	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
.	O
While	O
we	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
realize	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
project,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
numerous	I-ARG
coordination	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
required,	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
opinion	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
communicated	I-ARG
via	I-ARG
email,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
hundreds	I-ARG

thousands	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
emails	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	B-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
project	I-ARG
members	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
email	I-ARG
because	O
work	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
efficient	I-ARG

Professors	O
should	O
do	O
more	O
research	O
or	O
teach	O
students?	O
These	O
days,	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
university	O
professors	O
are	O
involved	O
in	O
scientific	O
research	O

Some	O
are	O
afraid	O
that	O
this	O

the	O

of	O
education	O
quality	O
and	O
suggest	O
them	O
to	O
spend	O
more	O
time	O
on	O
teaching	O

However,	O
according	O
to	O
my	O
experiences,	O
professors	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
encouraged	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
mainly	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
doing	B-ARG
research	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
method	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
self-improvement	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
.	O
Universities	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
relatively	I-ARG
fenced	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
research	I-ARG
projects	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
outside	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
by	B-ARG
doing	I-ARG
research,	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
catch	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
latest	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
technologies	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
still	I-ARG
remembered	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
professor	I-ARG
took	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
projects	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
college	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
was	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
invited	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
speech	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
universities	I-ARG
.	O
Although	O
my	B-ARG
university	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
high-ranking	I-ARG
list,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
gained	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
reputation	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
projects	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
research	I-ARG
projects	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
windows	I-ARG
opened	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
wider	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
professors	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
fully	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
research-friendly	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
provided	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
universities	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
common	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
state-of-the-art	I-ARG
laboratories	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
campus	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
you	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
talent	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
gathering	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
there	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
reason	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
discourage	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
.	O
We	B-ARG
all	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
Einstein	I-ARG
developed	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
theory	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
general	I-ARG
relativity	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
professor	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
HU	I-ARG
Berlin	I-ARG
.	O
Universities	B-ARG
positively	I-ARG
contribute	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
professors'	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
doing	B-ARG
research	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
teaching	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
projects,	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
practical	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
imply	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
practice	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
still	I-ARG
remembered	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
assistant	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
professor's	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
project	I-ARG
.	O
By	B-ARG
participating	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
it,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
opportunities	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
theories	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
textbooks	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
experiments	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
research	I-ARG
project	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
efficient	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
teaching	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
those	O
reasons,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
support	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
spending	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
.	O
While	B-ARG
extending	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
development,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
outcomes	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
researches	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
society	I-ARG

Learning	O

Every	O

As	O
for	O
the	O

you,	O

your	O

more	O
profound	O

In	O

the	O
learning	O
with	O
a	O

makes	O
us	O

more	O

of	O
studies	O
cause	O
they	O
assign	O
us	O
homework,	O
Nevertheless,	O
I	B-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
myself	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
The	O
distinguishing	O
fact	O
of	O
the	O
learning	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
ask	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
related	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
when	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
encounter	I-ARG
difficulty	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
out,	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
asking	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
difficulty	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
propitious	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
solve	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
instantly	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
professors	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
knowledge,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
dextrous	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
letting	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
know	I-ARG
something	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
incorporated	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
materials	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
books	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
webpages	I-ARG
.	O
Hence	O
I,	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
class,	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
communicate	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
coordinated	I-ARG
answer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
faced	I-ARG
problem,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
classmates	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
accustomed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
communicating	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
in	O
my	O
mind,	O
the	B-ARG
learning	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
efficient	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
myself	I-ARG
.	O
We	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
accomplish	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
assignments	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
little	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
within	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
ourself	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
the	B-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
leading	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
direction	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
This	B-ARG
gives	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
rise	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
educational	I-ARG
level	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
exited	I-ARG
degree	I-ARG
.	O
knowledge	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
thereby	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
improved	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
strengthened	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
of	O
course,	O
being	B-ARG
without	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
shortcomings	I-ARG
.	O
Notable	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
shortcomings	O
is	O
that	O
if	B-ARG
someone	I-ARG
faced	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
complicated	I-ARG
confusion	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
endeavors	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
making	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
miscarried,	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
ended	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
disappointment	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
for	B-ARG
one	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
depends	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
himself	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
learning,	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
improvement	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
ability,	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
regard	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
cooperation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
opinion,	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
unpromising	I-ARG
.	O
Hence	O
I	B-ARG
support	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
point	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG

However,	O
even	O
with	O
all	O

we	O

There	O
are	O

support	O
my	O
answer	O
.	O
Of	O
course,	O
new	B-ARG
technologies	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
it	B-ARG
takes	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
adapt	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
Since	O
we	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
informed	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
devices	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
produced	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
features	I-ARG
nearly	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
day,	I-ARG
many	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
lost	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	B-ARG
use	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
Iphone	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
personally	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
even	B-ARG
though	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
couple	I-ARG
months,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
features	I-ARG
proficiently	I-ARG
.	O
At	O
first,	O
I	B-ARG
tried	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
instructions	I-ARG
but,	I-ARG
soon,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
gave	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
because	O
I	B-ARG
found	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
time-consuming	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG

Next,	O
technology	B-ARG
destroys	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
language	I-ARG

Ever	O
since	O

used	I-ARG
computers	I-ARG

they	B-ARG
created	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

learning	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
list	O
my	O
reasons	O
as	O
follows	O

First,	O
indeed	O
classroom	B-ARG
learning	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
comparing	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
online	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
classmates,	I-ARG
because	O
if	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
classmates	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
performing	I-ARG
better,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
force	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
making	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
performance	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
When	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
First	I-ARG
Year	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
B	I-ARG
Com,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
study,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
saw	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
took	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
grades	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
me,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
influenced	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
intended	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
.	O
Finally	O
I	B-ARG
got	I-ARG
1st	I-ARG
rank	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
final	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
in	B-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
complete	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
time	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
makes	I-ARG
you	I-ARG

Moreover	O
you	B-ARG

learn	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
participating	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG
how	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
makes	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
better,	I-ARG

you	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
.	O
Third,	O
professors	B-ARG
play	I-ARG
vital	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
learning,	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
them	I-ARG

In	O
result	O
you	B-ARG
learn	I-ARG
quickly	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
I	O
have	O
my	O
personal	O
experience	O

For	B-ARG
Toefl	I-ARG
IBT	I-ARG
Coaching	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
depend	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
online	I-ARG
courses,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
1	I-ARG
month	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
realized	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
wasting	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
joined	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
institute	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
preparation	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
Toefl	I-ARG
IBT,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
1	I-ARG
month	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
felt	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
English	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
improving	I-ARG
faster	I-ARG
.	O
It's	O
undeniable	O
that	O
online	B-ARG
classes	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
supplementary,	I-ARG
but	O
they	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
substitute	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
existing	I-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
.	O
From	O
the	O
discussed	O
above,	O
we	O
can	O
easily	O
draw	O
the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
reasons	I-ARG

Part	O

a	O

a	O

In	O

do	O
not	O
support	O
the	O
concept	O
of	O
teenagers	O
doing	O
job	O

In	O
my	O
view,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teenager	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
he/she	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
and	O
this	O
is	O
for	O
two	O
reasons	O
.	O
The	O
main	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
students	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
lots	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
job,	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
starting	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
.	O
Students	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
management,	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
management	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
convince	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
words	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
when	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
worked	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sales-man	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
shop	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
year	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
i	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
job,	I-ARG
therefore,	O
i	B-ARG
had	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
manage	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
efficiently	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
had	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
manage	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
boss	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
homework	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
taught	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
manage	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
efficiently	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
quickly	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
effectively	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
I	B-ARG
learn	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
management	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
boss	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
shop,	I-ARG
i	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
manage	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
accounts	I-ARG
section	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
shop	I-ARG
.	O
From	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
i	I-ARG
learned,	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
manage	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
correctly	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
experience	I-ARG
taught	I-ARG
me,	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
.	O
Another	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
from	B-ARG
part	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
money,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
when	O
i	O
was	O
in	O
high	O
school	O
I	O
worked	O
as	O
a	O
home	O
tutor	O
.	O
I	O
taught	O
math	O
to	O
two	O
kids	O
of	O
my	O
neighbor	O
.	O
I	O
helped	O
them	O
to	O
understand	O
the	O
difficult	O
topics	O
of	O
the	O
books	O
.	O
By	B-ARG
tutoring	I-ARG
them,	I-ARG
i	I-ARG
earned	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
bought	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
books	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
after	B-ARG
taking	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
i	I-ARG
stopped	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
pocket	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
form	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
you	O
can	O
see,	O
part	B-ARG
time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
financially	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
sum,	O
I	O
am	O
sure;	O
some	O
people	O
will	O
oppose	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
part	O
time	O
job	O
for	O
students	O
.	O
They	O
will	O
argue,	O
it	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
destruct	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
as	O
i	B-ARG
did	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
hurt	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
result;	I-ARG
therefore,	O
i	O
believe	O
part	B-ARG
time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
Every	O
Student	O
should	O
do	O
part	O
time	O

beside	O
their	O
study	O
if	O
they	O
want	O

Which	O
is	O
better-	O
Learning	O
foreign	O

in	O

or	O

country?	O
Our	O
World	O
has	O
varied	O
cultures	O

each	O
culture	O

its	O

It	O

become	O
essential	O
for	O
a	O

learning	O
a	O
foreign	O
langauge	O
adds	O
on	O
to	O
a	O
person	O
skill-set	O
as	O
well	O
.	O
Also,	O
I	O
think	O
its	B-ARG
better	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
reasons	O
for	O
holding	O
that	O
opinion	O
are	O
illustrated	O
in	O
the	O
subsequent	O
paragraphs	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
possible	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
visit	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
as	O
it	B-ARG
requires	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
legal	I-ARG
formalities	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
earlier	I-ARG
periods,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
languge	I-ARG
.	O
But	O
with	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
advent	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
globalization,	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	B-ARG
Indian	I-ARG
sub-continent	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
centers	I-ARG
opened	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
trained	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
variety	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
languages	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
french,	I-ARG
german	I-ARG
etc	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
colleges	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
universities	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
introduced	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
curriculum	I-ARG
.	O
Students	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
set	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
languages	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
highly	B-ARG
qualified	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
accessible	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
schools	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
colleges	I-ARG
.	O
Third,	O
technology	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
played	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
reducing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
separation	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
languge	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
A	B-ARG
large	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
courses	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
online	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
forums	I-ARG

people	I-ARG

discuss	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
languages	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
country	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
cost	I-ARG
effective	I-ARG

there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
pool	I-ARG

Firstly,	O
several	B-ARG

However,	O
research	B-ARG

that	I-ARG

if	I-ARG
they	I-ARG

Many	B-ARG
colleges	I-ARG

foreign	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
vacations	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
after	I-ARG

To	O
quote	O
an	O
instance,	O
in	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
vacations	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
quarterly	I-ARG
exams	I-ARG

During	B-ARG
those	I-ARG

again	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
avoid	I-ARG
making	I-ARG

I	B-ARG
also	I-ARG
used	I-ARG

spend	I-ARG
my	I-ARG

on	I-ARG
developing	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
recreational	I-ARG
activity	I-ARG

learning	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
game	I-ARG

During	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
vacations,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
miss	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
restart	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
session	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
enthusiasm	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG

scoring	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
marks	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
quarter	I-ARG

Vacations	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
required	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
professionals	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
housekeepers	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
it	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
break	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
regular	I-ARG
commitment	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
allows	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
themselves,	I-ARG
heel	I-ARG

boost	I-ARG
desire	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
resuming	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
regular	I-ARG
schedule	I-ARG

Therefore	O
schools	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG

several	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Im	O
my	O
opinion,	O
saving	B-ARG
some	I-ARG
part	I-ARG

your	I-ARG

essential	I-ARG
due	O

you	B-ARG

neither	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
your	I-ARG

First,	O
there	B-ARG

The	B-ARG
global	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
conditions	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
days	I-ARG

tough	I-ARG

there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
unpredictable	I-ARG
factors	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
bank	I-ARG
account	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
example	O
I	B-ARG
remember	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
lost	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
could	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
move	I-ARG

you	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
sure	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
development	I-ARG

your	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
life	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
possible	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
unavoidable	I-ARG
expenses	I-ARG

you	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
afford	I-ARG
without	I-ARG

Back	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
remember	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
mine	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
little	I-ARG
savings	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

sell	I-ARG
it	I-ARG

Finally,	O
with	B-ARG
savings	I-ARG
you	I-ARG

Working	B-ARG
hard	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
saving	I-ARG

take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
time	I-ARG

As	O

In	O
addition,	O

essential	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Our	B-ARG
behavior	I-ARG

This	B-ARG

the	I-ARG
endangered	I-ARG
animals,	I-ARG

also	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

For	O

recent	B-ARG

the	I-ARG
United	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
there	O

we	B-ARG
definitely	I-ARG

our	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

Going	O

for	O
the	O
students	O
University	O
students	O
have	O
different	O
opinion	O
about	O
their	O
attendance	O
to	O

Some	O
students	O
believe	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
attend	O
classes	O
while	O
others	O
believe	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
optional	O
for	O
the	O
students	O

According	O
to	O
my	O
opinion,	O
because	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
level	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
education,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
maturity	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
I	O
strongly	O
agree	O
that	O
going	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
optional	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
begin	O
with,	O
going	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
waste	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
some	B-ARG
lecturers	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
read	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
text	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
reference	I-ARG
books	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
particular	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
module	I-ARG
.	O
Further,	O
they	B-ARG
didn't	I-ARG
explain	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
contents	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
was	I-ARG
waste	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
Because	O
the	B-ARG
university	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
grown	I-ARG
up,	I-ARG
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
ability	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
read	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
text	I-ARG
book	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
with	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
technology,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
collect	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
sources	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
from	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
Internet,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
read	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
articles	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
e-books	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG
video	I-ARG
tutorials	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
apparently	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
some	B-ARG
lecturers	I-ARG
deliver	I-ARG
lectures	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
informative	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
interesting	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
lectures,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
obviously	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
useful	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
waste	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
Additionally,	O
mostly	B-ARG
university	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lectures	I-ARG
.	O
Besides,	O
most	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
manage	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
expenses	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
Students	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
basis	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
schedule	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lectures	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
At	O
the	O
same	O
time,	O
rather	B-ARG
than	I-ARG
attending	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
boring	I-ARG
lecturers,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
participate	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
debate	I-ARG
competition,	I-ARG
swimming	I-ARG
meet,	I-ARG
Basketball	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
forth	I-ARG
.	O
From	O
that	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
relationships	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
a	O
nutshell,	O
although	O
few	B-ARG
brilliant	I-ARG
lecturers	I-ARG
deliver	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
informative	I-ARG
lectures,	I-ARG
some	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
boring	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
wasting	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
university,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
matured	I-ARG
mentally	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
physically	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
to	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
time,	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
optional,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG

a	O

in	O
my	O
opinion	O
a	O
closer	O
examination	O

deal	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
superficial	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
for	O

One	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
television	B-ARG

focus	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
famous	I-ARG
peoples'	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
audience	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
readership	I-ARG
.	O
Gutter	B-ARG
press	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
Tabloid	I-ARG

are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
replacing	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
papers	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
documentaries	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
.	O
Thanks	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Internet,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
online	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
access	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
and	O
therefore	O
mass	B-ARG
media	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
informed	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
readers	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
audience	I-ARG
.	O
Another	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
we	B-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
appearance	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
gossip	I-ARG
.	O
Nowadays,	B-ARG
unscrupulous	I-ARG
paparazzi	I-ARG
constantly	I-ARG
follow	I-ARG
celebrities	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
photo	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
eating	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
training	I-ARG
.	O
Newspapers	B-ARG
often	I-ARG
receive	I-ARG
accusations	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
checkbook	I-ARG
journalism;	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
magazines	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
stories	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
photos	I-ARG
.	O
Additionally,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
Reality	I-ARG
TV,	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG

situations,	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

like	I-ARG
"Big	I-ARG

To	O
sum	O
up,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
television,	B-ARG
magazines	I-ARG

newspapers	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
peoples'	I-ARG
private	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG

all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
reasons	I-ARG

to	I-ARG

give	I-ARG
exciting	I-ARG

It	O
is	O
not	O
necessary	O
for	O
university	O
students	O
to	O
attend	O
classes	O
Though	O
out	O
the	O
last	O
decade,	O
the	O
load	O
of	O
the	O
university	O
students	O
has	O
been	O
constantly	O
increasing	O
.	O
There	O
are	O
those	O
who	O
consider	O
that	O
university	O
students	O
cannot	O
attend	O
any	O
classes	O
until	O
the	O
students	O
pass	O
the	O
exam	O
.	O
There	O
are	O
those	O
who	O
said	O
that	O
student	O
can	O
attend	O
the	O
university	O
coarse	O
without	O
passing	O
the	O
exam	O
.	O
However,	O
from	O
my	O
perspective,	O
students	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
acquire	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
prerequisite	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
passing	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
reasons	O
to	O
be	O
illustrated	O
are	O
follows	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
the	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
constantly	I-ARG
expert	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
I	O
love	O
Physics	O
.	O
But	O
I	B-ARG
don't	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
electronics,	I-ARG
because	O
electronics	B-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
seen	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
And	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
0	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
physics	I-ARG
score	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
electronics	I-ARG
.	O
But	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
constantly	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
100	I-ARG
score	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
physics	I-ARG
.	O
And	B-ARG
if	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
until	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
pass	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
electronics,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
pass	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
entire	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
physics,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
fail	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
again	I-ARG
.	O
Luckily,	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
university,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
regardless	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
score	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
reach	I-ARG
.	O
And	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
physics	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
consideration	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
electronics	I-ARG
.	O
And	B-ARG
at	I-ARG
last,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
took	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
electronics	I-ARG
again	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
pass	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
policy	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
passing	I-ARG
exam,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
highly	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
uncultivated	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
one	I-ARG
fail	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
exam,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
participate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
.	O
And	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
nothing	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
campus	I-ARG
.	O
Then	O
he	B-ARG
or	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
online	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
days	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
nights	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
academic	I-ARG
achievement	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
decline	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
the	O
end,	O
this	B-ARG
student	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
loser	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
And	B-ARG
all	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
permit	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
failure	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
entire	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
.	O
Admittedly,	O
the	B-ARG
university	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
reach	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
allow	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
participate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
matter	I-ARG
whether	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
pass	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
test	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
.	O
But	O
the	B-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
access	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
eclipse	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
issue	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
lower	I-ARG
points	I-ARG
.	O
All	O
in	O
all,	O
the	B-ARG
university	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
allow	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
participate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classed	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
passing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
test	I-ARG
because	O
not	B-ARG
only	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
expert	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
campus	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
uncultivated	I-ARG
.	O

I'm	O
against	O
providing	O
more	O
money	O
to	O
professors	O
University	O
education	O
is	O
always	O
an	O
important	O
part	O
of	O
one's	O
life	O
.	O
That's	O
why	O
education	O
in	O
university	O
is	O
discussed	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
.	O
What	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
orientate	O
the	O
students?	O
Raising	O
the	O
salaries	O
of	O
professors	O
so?	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
no	O
.	O
The	B-ARG
professors	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
essential,	I-ARG
however,	O
the	B-ARG
schools	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
established	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
Money	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
update	I-ARG
resources,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
beneficial	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
instructors	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
following	O
are	O
my	O
opinions	O
.	O
To	O
begin	O
with,	O
the	B-ARG
school	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
emphasis	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
think	O
the	B-ARG
most	I-ARG
efficient	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
guide	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
actively	I-ARG
.	O
By	B-ARG
renewing	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
assignment	I-ARG
.	O
A	B-ARG
comfortable	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
attract	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
stay	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
students	B-ARG
spend	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
circulation	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
.	O
That	O
is	O
to	O
say,	O
students	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
assignments	I-ARG
so	O
the	B-ARG
quality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
assignments	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
the	B-ARG
competition	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
peers	I-ARG
enhances	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
forms	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
circulation	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
school,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classrooms	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
shabby	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
me,	O
I	B-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
spending	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
coffee	I-ARG
shop	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
staying	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
finish	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
assignment	I-ARG
.	O
It's	B-ARG
unpleasant	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
stay	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
coffee	B-ARG
shops	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
quiet,	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
classmates	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
finish	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
roughly	I-ARG
.	O
Besides,	O
the	B-ARG
ultimate	I-ARG
purpose	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
change,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
motivate	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
.	O
To	B-ARG
improve	I-ARG
education,	I-ARG
spending	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
raise	I-ARG
professors'	I-ARG
salary	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
inappropriate	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
will	O
the	O
university	O
filter	O
all	O
the	O
professors	O
overall?	O
Some	O
professors	O
don't	O
deserve	O
the	O
money	O
at	O
all,	O
then,	O
what's	O
the	O
point	O
to	O
spend	O
money	O
on	O
them?	O
High-salary	B-ARG
instructors	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
harder	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
won't	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
effect	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
was	I-ARG
news	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
raising	I-ARG
professors'	I-ARG
salary	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
country	I-ARG

This	B-ARG
event	I-ARG
provoked	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
demonstration	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
mostly	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
proposal	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

was	I-ARG
eliminating	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
raising	I-ARG

As	O
you	O
can	O
see,	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
policy	I-ARG

was	I-ARG
supported,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
demonstration	I-ARG
would	I-ARG

At	O

That's	O
the	O

I	B-ARG
against	I-ARG

if	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG

We	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
talk	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
listen	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
us,	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
ever	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
illustrate	O
this	O
point,	O
I	O
can	O
write	O
about	O
my	O
own	O
experience	O
.	O
When	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
14	I-ARG
years	I-ARG
old,	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
uncle	I-ARG
passed	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
felt	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
everything	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
.	O
Talking	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
frustrating	I-ARG
because	O
none	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
ever	I-ARG
felt	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
.	O
Since	O
I	B-ARG
was	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
my	B-ARG
dog	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
near	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
seemed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
deeply	I-ARG
feelings	I-ARG
.	O
Clearly,	O
although	O
pets	B-ARG
aren't	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
speak	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
us,	I-ARG
we	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
nonetheless	I-ARG
count	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
pets	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
useful	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
variety	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
nowadays	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
pet	I-ARG
therapy	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
becoming	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
popular	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
.	O
Researchers	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
discovered	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
pets	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
illnesses	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
dogs	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
blind	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
and	O
therefore	O
without	B-ARG
them	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
pets	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
depressed	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
because	O
their	B-ARG
presence	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
dogs	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
educated	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
criminals	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
sense	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
smell	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
drugs	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
I	O
am	O
strongly	O
convinced	O
that	O
pets	B-ARG
deserve	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
treated	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
members	I-ARG
because	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
reasons	O
mentioned	O
above,	O
namely	O
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG

they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
useful	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
situations	I-ARG

our	I-ARG

all	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
initial	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG

Our	B-ARG
difficult	I-ARG

us	I-ARG
robust	I-ARG

strong	I-ARG
unknowingly	I-ARG

We	B-ARG
might	I-ARG

time	I-ARG

life	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

we	I-ARG

back	I-ARG
about	I-ARG

I	B-ARG
had	I-ARG

fragile	I-ARG

emotionally	I-ARG

then	I-ARG
slowly	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
started	I-ARG

I	B-ARG
also	I-ARG

Nowadays,	O
the	O

bigger	O
and	O
bigger	O
.	O
If	O
students	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
used	O
to	O
the	O
society	O
quickly,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
them	I-ARG

take	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
.	O
There	O
are	O
some	O
reasons	O
can	O
support	O
my	O
view	O
.	O
First,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
few	I-ARG
opportunities	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
.	O
Because	O
most	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
contact	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
when	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
jobs,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
whom	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
My	B-ARG
friend	I-ARG
Lisa,	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
now,	I-ARG
tells	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
fabulous	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
Through	B-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job,	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
let	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
aspects	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
Lisa	B-ARG
thought	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
core;	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
knows	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
friends,	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
changes	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
true	I-ARG
core	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
thanks	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
provided;	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
confidence	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
parents	B-ARG
always	I-ARG
tell	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
tenser	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
because	O
we	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
it,	I-ARG
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
tense	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
we	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
.	O
Actually,	O
some	B-ARG
questionnaires	I-ARG
indicate	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
jobs,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
importantly;	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
expect	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
the	B-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
.	O
Third,	O
some	O
parents	O
are	O
afraid	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
effect	I-ARG
student'	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
.	O
Actually,	O
most	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
holiday,	I-ARG
so	O
it	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
effect	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
.	O
Compared	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
computers	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
day,	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
holiday	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
taking	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
let	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
parents	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
part-time	I-ARG
job	I-ARG

Being	B-ARG
by	I-ARG
nature	I-ARG
introvert,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
efforts	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
adjusting	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

Once,	B-ARG

I	I-ARG
sat	I-ARG

prepared	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

half	I-ARG

work	I-ARG
myself	I-ARG

making	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
my	B-ARG

In	O

who	O
believe	O
that	O
no	B-ARG
one	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
terms	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
whole-heartedly	O
agree	O
with	O
this	O
opinion	O
because	O
of	O
these	O
following	O
reasons	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
parents	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
born,	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
taught	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
little	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
smile,	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
walk	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ordinary	I-ARG
routines	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
eating	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
when	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
grow	I-ARG
bigger,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
fairy	I-ARG
tales	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
ethic	I-ARG
lessons	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
affect	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
till	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
at	B-ARG
school	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
bigger	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
sciences	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
languages,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
we	B-ARG
spend	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
families	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
think	O
when	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
school,	I-ARG
maybe	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
forget	I-ARG
parts	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lessons	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
but	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
we	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
forget	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
taught	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
because	O
we	B-ARG
use	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
I	B-ARG
believe	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
forget	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
told	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
grateful	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
.	O
Thirdly,	O
I	O
totally	O
believe	O
parents	B-ARG
love	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
sons	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
daughters	I-ARG
unconditionally	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
even	B-ARG
when	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
grow	I-ARG
older,	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
married	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
families	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
spouses	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
children,	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
realize	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
wrong	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
my	B-ARG
older	I-ARG
brother	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
got	I-ARG
married	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
lived	I-ARG
independently	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
two	I-ARG
years	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
faces	I-ARG
difficulties	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
comes	I-ARG
back	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
ask	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
advice	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
parents	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
.	O

from	O
my	O
perspective,	O
I	O
am	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
my	O
father	O
.	O
Most	O
of	O
workers	O
have	O
adapted	O
to	O
do	O

task	O

It	B-ARG
allows	I-ARG
us	I-ARG

As	B-ARG
a	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG

my	I-ARG

different	I-ARG
tasks	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG

Workers,	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
an	I-ARG

To	O
conclude,	O
in	B-ARG
this	I-ARG

Even	O

sometimes	B-ARG
you	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

In	O
personal	O

we	O
have	O
some	O
responsibilities	O
towards	O
other	O
people	O
People	O
should	O
sometimes	O
do	O
things,	O
even	O
though	O
they	O
don't	O
enjoy	O
it	O

This	O
is	O
basic	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
lives	O
.	O
There	O
may	O
be	O
small	O
or	O
big	O
things,	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
people	O
should	O
accept	O
them,	O
because	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
is	O
about	O
responsibilities	O

Moreover,	O

In	O
this	O

the	O
reasons	O
for	O
why	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
people	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
doing	O
will	O
be	O
explored	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
most	B-ARG
people's	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
filled	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
tasks	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
.In	O
personal	O
live,	O
we	O
have	O
some	O
responsibilities	O
towards	O
to	O
other	O
people,	O
there	O
is	O
nobody	O
who	O
likes	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
responsibilities	O
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
housework	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
me,	I-ARG
although	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
husband	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
them,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
really	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
them,	I-ARG
however	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,professional	O
lives	O
are	O
filled	O
with	O
tasks	O
that	O
is	O
neccessary	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
jobs	O
.	O
Nobody	B-ARG
likes	I-ARG
attending	I-ARG
boring	I-ARG
conferences,	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
isn't	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
anyone	I-ARG
.	O
I'm	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
asistant	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
university,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
univesity	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
ours	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
professor	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
isn't	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
relationships,	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
asistans	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
talk	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
situation,	I-ARG
although	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
ask	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
field	I-ARG
.	O
Thirdly,	O
doing	B-ARG
something	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
individual	I-ARG
doesn't	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
led	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
enjoyment	I-ARG
.	O
People	B-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
attend	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
insisting	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
although	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
one	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
tell	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
husband	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
dance	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
.	O
After	B-ARG
insisting	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
friends,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
attended,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
got	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
enjoyable	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
continued	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
six	I-ARG
months	I-ARG
although	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
left	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
month	I-ARG
.	O
Nobody	O
has	O
a	O
life	O
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun;	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
unpleasant	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
boring	I-ARG
parts	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
liked	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
anyone,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
responsibilities	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
individual's	I-ARG
live	I-ARG

Young	O

preference	O
on	O
how	O
long	O
they	O

with	O
their	O

As	O

want	O
to	O

But,	O
the	O

what	O
is	O
the	O
right	O
age	O
for	O
young	O
adults	O
to	O
leave	O
their	O

and	O
start	O
living	O
on	O
their	O

is	O
a	O
contentious	O
one	O
.	O
Personally,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
young	B-ARG
adults	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
period	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
Living	B-ARG
on	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
commitment	I-ARG
.	O
At	B-ARG
younger	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
paying	I-ARG
job,	I-ARG
so	O
It	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG
task	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
rent,	I-ARG
food,	I-ARG
utilities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
expenses	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
sustain	I-ARG
yourself	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
living	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
wise	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
until	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
head	I-ARG
start	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
professional	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
reasonable	I-ARG
income	I-ARG
.	O
Another	B-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
period	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
enhanced	I-ARG
emotional	I-ARG
attachment	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
Parents	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
advice	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
changes	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Living	B-ARG
together	I-ARG
develops	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
discussing	I-ARG
adult's	I-ARG
physiological	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
psychological	I-ARG
changes	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
Young	B-ARG
adults	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
reluctant	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
discuss	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
move	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
thus	I-ARG
missing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
input	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
While	O
some	O
critics	O
may	O
argue	O
that,	O
young	B-ARG
adults	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
most	B-ARG
young	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
inclined	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
unprecedented	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
freedom	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
freedom	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
party	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
night,	I-ARG
smoke	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
drugs	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
a	O
nutshell,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
young	B-ARG
adults	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
sure	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
sustain	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
unwise	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
trade	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
period	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
late	I-ARG
night	I-ARG
parties	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
drugs	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
to	B-ARG
cope	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
physiological	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
psychological	I-ARG
changes	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
struggle	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
oneself	I-ARG
digress	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
destined	I-ARG
path,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
young	I-ARG

However,	O
the	B-ARG
disadvantages	I-ARG

For	O

nowadays	B-ARG

Recently,	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
social	O
concern	O
in	O

to	O
whether	O
mobile	O

have	O
a	O
negative	O
effect	O
in	O
our	O

Indeed,	O

have	O
been	O
widely	O

for	O
people	O

all	O

bringing	O

into	O
our	O

However,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
concerned,	O
I	O
strongly	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
view	O
that	O
this	B-ARG
great	I-ARG
invention	I-ARG
causes	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG

In	O
the	O
first	O
place,	O
spending	B-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
phones	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
exert	I-ARG
adverse	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
the	O
first	O
place,	O
as	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
increasingly	I-ARG
tend	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
focus	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
relay	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
phones,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
lose	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
interest	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
meeting	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
so	O
that	O
distraction	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
developed	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
continuous	B-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
mobile	I-ARG
phone	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
damage	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
eyesight	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
posture	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
types	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
phone	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
aggressive	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
nature	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
"Iron	I-ARG
man"	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
those	I-ARG
games,	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
rewarded	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
violent,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
violence	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
repeated	I-ARG
again	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
again	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
many	B-ARG
games	I-ARG
involve	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
helping	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
character	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
kill	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
shoot,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
increased	I-ARG
aggressive	I-ARG
feelings,	I-ARG
thoughts	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
behaviours	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
the	B-ARG
hardship	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
developed	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
other	O
people	O
may	O
perceive	O
this	O
issue	O
from	O
different	O
viewpoint	O
.	O
With	B-ARG
rapid	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
internet,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
quick	I-ARG
electronic	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
via	I-ARG
internet	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
as	B-ARG
lots	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
chatting	I-ARG
apps	I-ARG
available	I-ARG
online	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
"Weichat",	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
tend	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
send	I-ARG

free	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

their	I-ARG
phones	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
mobile	O

have	O
shortened	O
the	O

After	O
having	O
considered	O
all	O
the	O
problems	O
that	O
I	O

discussed	O
above,	O
we	O
can	O
finally	O
draw	O
a	O
conclusion	O
that	O
although	O

brings	I-ARG
convenience	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

that	O
using	B-ARG

there	B-ARG

such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
Twitter	I-ARG

also	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

Another	O
perspective,	O
using	B-ARG

The	O

this	O

made	O
some	B-ARG

become	I-ARG

as	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
using	I-ARG

However,	O
people	B-ARG

I	O

that	O
the	B-ARG
merits	I-ARG

below:	O
Competitive	B-ARG
children	I-ARG
are	I-ARG

to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
confident	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
handle	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
situations	I-ARG
independently	I-ARG

This	O
factor	O
initially	O
arises	O
from	O
the	O

where	O

feel	O
more	O

This	B-ARG
factor	I-ARG

them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
successful	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG

but	O
will	O
also	O
restrict	O
them	O
in	O
many	O
ways	O

For	O

MNCs	B-ARG
are	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

work,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
competitive	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
difficulty	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
managing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

However,	O
those	B-ARG
who	I-ARG

create	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sense	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
co-operation	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

they	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
a	B-ARG
balance	I-ARG
between	I-ARG

should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O
many	O
of	O
us	O
would	O
agree	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
people;	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
hours,	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
focus	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
By	B-ARG
working	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
long,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
tired,	I-ARG
lazy	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
reluctant	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
carry	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
exercise	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
remain	I-ARG
fit	I-ARG

healthy	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
eventually	I-ARG
loose	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
sick	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
they	B-ARG
become	I-ARG
extensively	I-ARG
addicted	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
workaholic	I-ARG
type	I-ARG
persons	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
repercussion	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
severe	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
families	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
remain	I-ARG
deprived	I-ARG
off	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
losing	I-ARG
balance	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
family	I-ARG

personal	I-ARG
life	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
these	B-ARG
workaholic	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
contribution	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
society	I-ARG

As	O
they	B-ARG

such	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG

For	O

I	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
boss's	I-ARG
example;	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
extended	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
office	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
years	I-ARG
.	O
Recently,	B-ARG
his	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
drastically	I-ARG
affected	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
broke	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
wife	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
totally	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
chaos	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
cries	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
started	I-ARG
regretting	I-ARG
afterwards	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
trying	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
manage	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
seems	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
late	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude	O
this,	O
I	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
strongly	I-ARG
emphasis	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
recommend,	I-ARG
Government	I-ARG
must	I-ARG
include	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
clause	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
maximum	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

its	I-ARG

enforce	I-ARG

do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG

This	B-ARG

my	B-ARG
term	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

man	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
achievements	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
income	I-ARG
.	O
Money	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
undeniably	I-ARG
pivotal,	I-ARG
but	O
ways	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
earning	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
.	O
A	B-ARG
person's	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
prosperity	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
state	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
gained	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
ethically	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
himself	I-ARG
.	O
Nevertheless,	O
a	B-ARG
man	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
accomplishment	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
hard-working,	I-ARG

Whether	B-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
achievement,	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
man	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
laudable	I-ARG

More	O
importantly,	O
the	B-ARG
more	I-ARG
beneficial	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
achievement	I-ARG
is,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
successful	I-ARG
he	I-ARG

For	O

Thomas	B-ARG
Edison	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
undeniably	I-ARG
considered	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
greatest	I-ARG
inventors	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
20th	I-ARG

since	O
his	B-ARG

for	I-ARG
mankind	I-ARG

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
the	B-ARG
fact	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
knowing	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
man's	I-ARG
utilization	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
remains	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
dark	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
judging	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
income	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
difficult,	I-ARG
especially	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
aspect	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
using	B-ARG

a	I-ARG
scale	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

some	I-ARG

look	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
gorgeous	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
advertisement,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
buy	I-ARG
goods	I-ARG
impulsively	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
second	I-ARG
thought	I-ARG
.	O
A	B-ARG
good	I-ARG
advertisement	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
convince	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
believe	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
want,	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
though	I-ARG
it	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG

there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG

people	I-ARG
purchase	I-ARG

However,	O
buying	B-ARG
habit	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
individuals,	I-ARG
the	B-ARG
advertisement	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
buy,	I-ARG
sometimes	B-ARG
it	I-ARG
depends	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
one's	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
ability	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG

things	I-ARG
impulsively	I-ARG

hand,	O
children	B-ARG

adolescents	I-ARG
who	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
possible	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
buy	I-ARG

impulsively	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
considering	I-ARG
whether	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
not,	I-ARG
since	O
they	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
ability	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
define	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
think	O
buying	B-ARG

is	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
entirely	I-ARG

for	B-ARG

it	I-ARG

it	B-ARG

their	O

want	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG

can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
students	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
job	I-ARG

Although	O
those	O
above	O
reasons	O

acceptable,	O
I	O
would	O
argue	O
that	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
studying	B-ARG
music,	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
enables	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
potentials	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
discovering	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
to	B-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
labor	I-ARG
market,	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
require	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
soft	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
teamwork,	I-ARG
presentation	I-ARG

For	O
instance,	O
through	B-ARG
taking	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sport,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
team	I-ARG
spirit	I-ARG

learn	I-ARG
lessons	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
teamwork	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
these	B-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
might	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Finally,	O
children's	B-ARG

do	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

In	O

the	B-ARG

a	I-ARG
primary	I-ARG

For	O

In	B-ARG

Instead	B-ARG

the	I-ARG

both	B-ARG

the	B-ARG

and	I-ARG
professional	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
directly	I-ARG
seen	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
fans	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
means	O
that	O
people	B-ARG
understand	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
efforts	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
training	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
directly	I-ARG
linked	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
results	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
this	B-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
self-made	I-ARG
celebrity	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
inspire	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
talents	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
application	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
perseverance	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
other	B-ARG
celebrities	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
musician	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
achieved	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
career	I-ARG
.	O
Take	B-ARG
Michael	I-ARG
Jackson	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
example,	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
widely	I-ARG
spread	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
extremely	I-ARG
welcomed	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
younger	I-ARG
generation	I-ARG
.	O
His	B-ARG
songs	I-ARG
spread	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
suggests	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG

In	O
summary,	O
although	O
some	B-ARG
celebrities	I-ARG
misguide	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
showing	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
external	I-ARG
wealth	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
appearance,	I-ARG
other	B-ARG

I	O

that	O
by	B-ARG

watch	I-ARG

at	I-ARG
both	I-ARG

can	I-ARG
adversely	I-ARG

If	B-ARG

much	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

it	I-ARG

negatively	I-ARG

It	O

true	O
that	O
TV	B-ARG

one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
prime	I-ARG
source	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
data	I-ARG

By	B-ARG
watching	I-ARG
TV,	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
extra-curriculum	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
Cooking	B-ARG
programs	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
dishes	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
similarly,	I-ARG
sports	I-ARG
events	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
cricket,	I-ARG

teach	I-ARG
leadership	I-ARG

building	I-ARG
skills,	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
.	O
But	O
on	O
other	O
hand,	O
watching	B-ARG
TV	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
continuously	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
adversely	I-ARG
impact	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
health	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
poor	I-ARG
eyesight	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
ages	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
childhood,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
back	I-ARG
pain	I-ARG
.	O
Sometimes,	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG
restrictive	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
allowed	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
ages	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
major	I-ARG
psychological	I-ARG
consequences	I-ARG
.	O
Many	B-ARG
times,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
addictive	I-ARG

their	I-ARG
favorite	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
Cartoon	I-ARG
channels,	I-ARG

easily	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
distracted	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
period	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
seriously	I-ARG
impact	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
grades	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
believe	O
demerits	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
outweigh	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
merits	I-ARG

thus	O
if	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
allowed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
freely	I-ARG

TV	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
proper	I-ARG
controls	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
it	I-ARG

Old	O

Throughout	O

its	O
stronger	O
adaptability	O
and	O
advancement	O
than	O
its	O

This	O
is	O
still	O
true	O
in	O
the	O
industrial	O
society	O
nowadays,	O
where	O
younger	O
workers	O
are	O
preferably	O
employed	O
and	O

rather	O
than	O
over-50	O
workers	O

There	O
are	O
three	O
reasons	O
that	O
can	O
explain	O
their	O
unresponsiveness	O
to	O
the	O
modern	O
workplace	O
.	O
First	O
and	O
foremost,	O
old	B-ARG
workers	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
patch	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
younger	I-ARG
ones	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
unchanged	I-ARG
paradigm	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
old	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
raised	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
poverty,	I-ARG
probably	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
war,	I-ARG
look	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
pessimistic	I-ARG
point	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
view	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
misery	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
ingrained	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
refuse	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
change,	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
precisely,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
accept	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
existence	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
modernity	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
most	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
piece	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
parts	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
machine	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
done	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
robot	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
disbelief	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
efficiency	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
safety	I-ARG
compared	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
human's	I-ARG
capability	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
their	B-ARG
unresponsiveness	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
attributed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
attitude	I-ARG
towards	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
that	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
aware	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
deteriorating	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
enthusiasm	I-ARG
comes	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
taste	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
monotony	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
safe	I-ARG
ideology	I-ARG
.	O
This,	B-ARG
by	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
means,	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
outweigh	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
youngsters'	I-ARG
adventurousness	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
bravery	I-ARG
.	O
Blatantly	B-ARG
seen,	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
stems	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
whose	I-ARG
enterprising	I-ARG
ideas	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
catch	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
regarded	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
wind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
refreshment	I-ARG
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
knowledge	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
worth	I-ARG
mentioning	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
key	I-ARG
factor	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
workers	I-ARG
outrank	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
elderly	I-ARG
.	O
Who	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
employer	I-ARG
choose,	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
man	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
old-fashioned	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
man	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
fundermentaly	I-ARG
subject,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
knows	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
program	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
speak	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
languages	I-ARG

Not	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
undermine	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
workers,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
authority	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
basically	I-ARG
required	I-ARG
fields	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
incompetence	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
workplace	I-ARG
.	O
All	O
in	O
a	O
nutshell,	O
workers	B-ARG
over	I-ARG
50	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
proven	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
subordinate	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
following	I-ARG
generation	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
aspects	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
in	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
importance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
remain	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
harmonious	I-ARG
coexistence	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
both	I-ARG

no	O

in	O

These	O
machines	O
reduce	O
the	O
physical	O
work	O
done	O
by	O
humans	O
.	O
Some	O
people	O
think	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
a	O

it	O

critiqued	O
before	O
a	O

conclusion	O

It	O
is	O
felt	O
by	O
many	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
usage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
machines	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
harmful	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
humans	I-ARG
since	O
machines	B-ARG
decrease	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
done	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	B-ARG
many	I-ARG
institutions	I-ARG
staircases	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
replaced	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
lifts	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
days	I-ARG
.	O
People	B-ARG
opt	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
elevators	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
climbing	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
two	I-ARG
flight	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
stairs	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
confirmed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
researches	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
usage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
elevators	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
workplaces	I-ARG
promotes	I-ARG
obesity	I-ARG
.	O
So	O
this	B-ARG
example	I-ARG
clearly	I-ARG
shows	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
linkage	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
machines	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
adverse	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
coin,	O
many	O
people	O
believe	O
that	O
usage	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
machines	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
consumed	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
similar	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
.	O
Take	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
example	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
processors	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
kitchens	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
work	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
chopping,	I-ARG
blending,	I-ARG
grating,	I-ARG
kneading	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
imagine	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
simple	I-ARG
machine	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
homes	I-ARG
.	O
Thus	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
obvious	O
that	O
using	B-ARG
machines	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
tasks	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
consuming	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
cumbersome	I-ARG
.	O
After	O
analyzing	O
these	O
two	O
points	O
of	O
view,	O
it	O
is	O
believed	O
that	O
using	B-ARG
machines	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
advantageous	I-ARG
as	O
machines	B-ARG
make	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
smooth	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
back	I-ARG
seat	I-ARG
because	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
exercise	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
stay	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
it	O
is	O
hoped	O
that	O
in	O
coming	O
time	O
people	O
will	O
enjoy	O
using	O
more	O

The	O

interest	O
of	O
many	O

However,	O
I	O

all,	O
public	B-ARG

minimize	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

because	O

It	O
is	O
agreed	O
that	O
following	B-ARG

can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
dangerous	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
youth	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
will	O
be	O
proven	O
by	O
looking	O
at	O
how	O
health	O

is	O
affected	O
by	O

all,	O
it	O

Many	B-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
indulge	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
drugs	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
start	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
survey	I-ARG
carried	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
university,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
asked	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
start	I-ARG
smoking,	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
forty	I-ARG
percent	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
individuals	I-ARG
answered	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
wanted	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
look	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
favorite	I-ARG
screen	I-ARG
actor	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
smoking	I-ARG
cigarettes	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
example	O
makes	O
it	O
clear	O
that	O
imitating	B-ARG
celebrities	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
influence	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
individuals	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
it	O
is	O
believed	O
that	O
when	B-ARG
youth	I-ARG
follows	I-ARG
celebrities	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
affects	I-ARG
personality	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
.	O
Adolescents	B-ARG
follow	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
attire	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
favorite	I-ARG
stars	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance	O
recently	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
poll	I-ARG
conducted	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
American	I-ARG
magazine	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
found	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
complain	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
teenagers	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
derogatory	I-ARG
words	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
abusive	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
schools	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
this	O
example	O
makes	O
it	O
obvious	O
that	O
these	B-ARG
glamorous	I-ARG
celebrities	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
poor	I-ARG
effect	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
conduct	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
Thus	O
to	O
conclude,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
when	B-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
follow	I-ARG
celebrities,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
affects	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
overall	I-ARG
effect	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
personality	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
individual	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore	O
it	O
is	O
recommended	O
that	O
young	O
people	O
should	O
be	O
educated	O
not	O
to	O
follow	O
these	O
celebrities	O
blindly,	O
rather	O
they	O
should	O
focus	O
on	O
their	O
career	O

that	O
they	O

the	O
statue	O

education	O
are	O
believed	O
as	O
a	O
sustainable	O
policy	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
held	O
.	O
Nowadays,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
institutions	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
accept	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
average	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
male	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
female	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
strongly	O
agree	O
about	O
this	O
statement	O
.	O
The	B-ARG
proportion	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
women	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
rising	I-ARG
year	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
year	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
parts	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
recently	I-ARG
.	O
Automatically,	O
the	B-ARG
issue	I-ARG
stimulates	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
stakeholders	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
places	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
preparations	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
stabilising	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
growth	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
We	O
can	O
see	O
now	O
that	O
women	B-ARG
tend	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
fields	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
past	I-ARG
normally	I-ARG
done	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
men	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
engineers,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
dealing	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
machines	I-ARG
.	O
Those	O
activities	O
have	O
proven	O
that	O
women	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
men's	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
female	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
indicated	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
capability	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
men	I-ARG
.	O
Another	O
reason	O
is	O
order	O
to	O
gaining	O
higher	O
education	O
degree	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
required	O
to	O
establish	O
a	O
person's	O
career	O
.	O
These	B-ARG
days,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
proper	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
degree	I-ARG
certificate	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
Universities	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
learning	B-ARG
from	I-ARG
human's	I-ARG
history,	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
widen	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
facing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
situation	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
workplace	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG
taught	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
college	I-ARG
.	O
According	O
to	O
this	O
opinion,	O
giving	B-ARG
equal	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
men	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
women	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
must	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
the	B-ARG
needs	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
developed-skills	I-ARG
and	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
health	I-ARG

relegious	I-ARG
aspect	I-ARG

Firstly,	O
health	B-ARG
improvement	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
reason	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
vegetarian	I-ARG
diet	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
popular	I-ARG

Many	B-ARG
researchers	I-ARG

that	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG

vegetable	I-ARG
contain	I-ARG
antioxydant	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG

This	O
fortifies	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
a	B-ARG
vegetable	I-ARG
diet	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
Although	O
some	O
argue	O
that	O
a	B-ARG
meal	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
meat	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
protein	I-ARG
intake,	I-ARG
it	B-ARG

to	O
a	O

Some	B-ARG
religion,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG

that	I-ARG

were	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
previous	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
so	O
eating	B-ARG
their	I-ARG

you	I-ARG
eat	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
flesh	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
your	I-ARG

It	O

this	O

However,	O
I	O
am	O
convinced	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
vital	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
follow	I-ARG
one's	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
religious	I-ARG
practices	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

To	O
sum	O
up,	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
for	O
me	O
that	O
people	B-ARG
choose	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
vegetarians	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
religious	I-ARG
concern	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG

However,	O
a	O
meal	O
which	O

nutritionally	O

always	O
most	O
recommended	O

The	O
maintenance	O
of	O
traditional	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
the	O
application	O

some	O
countries	O
will	O
be	O
accompanied	O

modern	O

It	O

them	O

However,	O
from	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
what	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
expected,	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
change	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tradition	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
disappearance	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
undeniable	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
country's	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
passed	I-ARG
down	I-ARG
mainly	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
in	B-ARG
Vietnam,	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
water	I-ARG
puppet	I-ARG
shows	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
once	I-ARG
demonstrated	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
seasonal	I-ARG
agriculture	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
communal	I-ARG
activities,	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
today	I-ARG
substituted	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
cinemas	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
concerts	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
means	O
the	B-ARG
young	I-ARG
generation	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
solely	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
access	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
ancestor's	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
books	I-ARG
and	I-ARG

which	I-ARG
otherwise	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
absorbed	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
tradition,	O
a	B-ARG
person	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
look	I-ARG
back	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
past,	I-ARG
mainly	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
custom	I-ARG
handcraft	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
antique	I-ARG
lifestyle,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
progress	I-ARG

Understanding	B-ARG
why,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
predecessors	I-ARG
survived	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
thick	I-ARG

thin	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
probably	I-ARG

To	O
sumarize,	O
there	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
never	I-ARG

any	I-ARG
replacement	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ones	I-ARG
that	I-ARG

The	O

nothing	O

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
the	B-ARG
zoo	I-ARG
deserves	I-ARG
maintenance	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
respect	I-ARG
for	O
two	O
specific	O
reasons	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
the	B-ARG
zoo	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
considered	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
regard	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
providing	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
vivid	I-ARG
materials	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
learners	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
zoos,	I-ARG
pupils	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
observing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
habit	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
unique	I-ARG
instinct	I-ARG
of,	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
instance,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lion	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
crocodile	I-ARG
.	O
At	O
a	O
higher	O
level,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
biological	I-ARG
research	I-ARG
based	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
practical	I-ARG
statistics	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
recordings,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
otherwise	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
hand	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
means	O
that	O
the	O
zoos	B-ARG
conduce	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
acquisition	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
levels	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
the	B-ARG
zoo	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
serve	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
ecological	I-ARG
protection	I-ARG
.	O
Nowadays	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
process	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
globalisation	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
accompanied	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
encroachment	I-ARG
upon	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
habitats,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
consequently	I-ARG
calls	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
zoos	I-ARG
.	O
What	O
is	O
more,	O
the	B-ARG
ever-increasing	I-ARG
huntings	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
having	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
heavy	I-ARG
toll	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
rare	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
specious	I-ARG
species	I-ARG
.	O
Only	B-ARG
when	I-ARG
zoos	I-ARG
appear	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
distinction-driven	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
as:	I-ARG
giraffe,	I-ARG

leopard	I-ARG
provided	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
inaccessible	I-ARG
territory	I-ARG

In	O
sum,	O
the	B-ARG
role	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
zoos	I-ARG
towards	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
undeniably	I-ARG
indispensable	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
highly	O

that	O

I	O

how	I-ARG

every	I-ARG

There	O
are	O
several	O
reasons	O
why	O
saving	B-ARG

be	I-ARG
seen	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
waste	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
we	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
expands	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
use	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
languages,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
expensive	I-ARG
because	O
educational	B-ARG
programmes	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
given	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
some	B-ARG
certain	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Southern	I-ARG
Vietnam	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
trying	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
secondary	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
originally	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
khmer	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
speak	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
beside	I-ARG
Vietnamese,	I-ARG
so	O
the	B-ARG
local	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
recently	I-ARG
struggled	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
costly	I-ARG
investments	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
teachers,	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
appropriate	I-ARG
materials	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
it	O
is	O
obvious	O
that	O
in	B-ARG
many	I-ARG
aspects	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
communication,	I-ARG
trade,	I-ARG
cooperation	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
transaction,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
absolutely	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
.	O
Despite	O
of	O
the	O
above	O
arguments,	O
i	O
still	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
government	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
preserve	I-ARG
minority	I-ARG
languages	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
because	O
language	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
seen	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
method	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
forming	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
must	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
undergone	I-ARG
thousands	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
years;	I-ARG
thus,	O
it	B-ARG
deserves	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
respected	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
preserved	I-ARG
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
language	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
factors	I-ARG
creating	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
differences	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
unique	I-ARG
cutures	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
saving	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
languages	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
case	I-ARG
generally	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
element	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
diversity's	I-ARG
preservation	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
although	O
letting	B-ARG
languages	I-ARG
spoken	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
ethnic	I-ARG
minorities	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
extinct	I-ARG
seems	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
beneficial,	I-ARG
it	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
definitely	I-ARG
impact	I-ARG
seriously	I-ARG

many	I-ARG
other	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
plenty	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
really	I-ARG

Finally,	O
some	B-ARG

choose	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

While	B-ARG

I	I-ARG
strongly	I-ARG
disagree	I-ARG

One	O
can	O
not	O
deny	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
if	B-ARG
petrol	I-ARG

are	I-ARG
raised,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
might	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

Taxation	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
tackled	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
issue	I-ARG
simply	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
diverting	I-ARG
people	I-ARG

public	I-ARG
transportations	I-ARG
such	I-ARG

Additionally,	O
for	B-ARG
those	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
likelihood	I-ARG
it	I-ARG

on	I-ARG
long	I-ARG

crowded	I-ARG

However,	O
taxation	B-ARG
on	I-ARG
flamable	I-ARG

backfire	I-ARG
by	I-ARG

To	O
be	O
precise,	O
the	B-ARG

the	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
level	I-ARG

violence	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
society	I-ARG

I	O
totally	O
agree	O
with	O
this	O
viewpoint	O
for	O
some	O
specific	O
reasons	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
given	O
and	O
analyzed	O
in	O
the	O
following	O
paragraphs	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
we	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
police	I-ARG
armed	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
guns	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
kinds	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
legal	I-ARG
weapons	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
attempts	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
protect	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
civilians	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
himself	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
criminals	B-ARG
todays	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
sophisticated	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
acquire	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
weapons	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
cope	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
police	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
serve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
nefarious	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
citizens	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
shot	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
police	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
offenders	I-ARG
accidentally	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
while	B-ARG
on	I-ARG
duty,	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
private	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG
affected	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
cars,	I-ARG
houses,	I-ARG
streets	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
destroyed	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
guns	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
a	B-ARG
society	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
police	I-ARG
force	I-ARG
carries	I-ARG
guns	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
definitely	I-ARG
seen	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
highly	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
police	B-ARG
force	I-ARG
carries	I-ARG
guns	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
societies	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
people	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
police	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
ones	I-ARG
usually	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
dangerous	I-ARG
diverse	I-ARG
crime's	I-ARG
categories	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
theft,	I-ARG
robbery,	I-ARG
murder,	I-ARG
rape,	I-ARG
vandalism,	I-ARG
arson	I-ARG
.	O
Obviously,	O
Those	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
possibly	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
strongest	I-ARG
evidences	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
determine	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
suffering	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
level	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
violence	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
from	O
the	O
above	O
views,	O
although	O
being	B-ARG
armed	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
guns	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

Firstly,	O
it	O

that	O

been	O
one	O

the	O

Reducing	O
such	O
contents	O
from	O

is	O
the	O
widely	O
accepted	O
solution	O
endorsed	O
by	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
governments	O
throughout	O
the	O
world	O
today	O
.	O
Personally,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
governments	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
definitely	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
components	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
minimum	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
kidvids,	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
contents	I-ARG
remain	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
shows	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
mature	I-ARG
minds	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
entirely	I-ARG
reasonable	I-ARG
.	O
Admittedly,	O
reducing	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
proportion	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
content	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
shows	I-ARG
could,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
degree,	I-ARG
decrease	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
overall	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
rate	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
tackle	O
this	O
problem	O
more	O
effectively,	O
governments	B-ARG
must	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
prohibit	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
types	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
content	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
children’s	I-ARG
television	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
mental	I-ARG
immaturity,	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
youngsters	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
incapable	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
distinguishing	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
wrong	I-ARG
.	O
Little	O
wonder,	O
then,	O
that	O
by	B-ARG
watching	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
programs	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
videos,	I-ARG
juveniles	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
aggressive	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
offensive	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
tendency	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
commit	I-ARG
crimes	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
it	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
governments	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
establish	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
intensive	I-ARG
law	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
prevents	I-ARG
teenagers	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
brutal	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
Shows	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
.	O
Nevertheless,	O
it	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
certainly	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
violation	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
adults’	I-ARG
civil	I-ARG
liberties,	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
governments	I-ARG
implement	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
restricted	I-ARG
regulation	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
shows	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
mature	I-ARG
audiences	I-ARG
.	O
Frequently,	O
adults	B-ARG
watch	I-ARG
horror	I-ARG

or	I-ARG
war	I-ARG
movies	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

On	O

a	B-ARG

holds	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG

tackle	I-ARG

An	B-ARG
obvious	I-ARG
example	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
happens	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
The	I-ARG
United	I-ARG
State,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
man	I-ARG
killed	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

ten	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cinema	I-ARG
using	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

shot	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
foot	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
paralyze	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
.	O
Obviously,	O
police	B-ARG
officers	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
force	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
surrender,	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
weapon	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
escaping	I-ARG

poses	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
danger	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
public	I-ARG

As	O
a	O
result,	O
some	B-ARG
military	I-ARG
weapons	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
encouraging	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
police	I-ARG
officers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
protect	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
rate	I-ARG

violence	I-ARG

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
reason	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
level	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
bloody	I-ARG
increases	I-ARG
significantly	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
communities	I-ARG

Firstly,	O
the	B-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
unemployment	I-ARG
rate	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
risen	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
15	I-ARG
percent	I-ARG

several	I-ARG
globalized	I-ARG

Many	B-ARG
well-qualified	I-ARG

well-educated	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
money	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
cost	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
extremely	I-ARG
expensive,	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
impresses	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
under	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
poverty	I-ARG
line	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

anything	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
guns	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
used	I-ARG

some	I-ARG

Besides,	O

is	O
that	O
dangerous	B-ARG

Moreover,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
many	I-ARG

Recent	B-ARG

sold	I-ARG
pervasively	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

Furthermore,	O
living	B-ARG

Unemployed	B-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
life	B-ARG

To	O
some	O
extent,	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
agree	O
with	O
this	O
assertion	O
because	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
criminal	B-ARG
minds	I-ARG
that	I-ARG

First	O
of	O

it	O

that	O
if	B-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG

somehow	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
decrease	I-ARG
because	O
fewer	B-ARG

However,	O
this	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
simple	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
sounds	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
stringent	B-ARG
gun	I-ARG
control	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
decrease	I-ARG
violence	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
because	O
most	B-ARG
gun	I-ARG
violence	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
committed	I-ARG
with	I-ARG

obtained	I-ARG
illegally	I-ARG

People	B-ARG
who	I-ARG

commit	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
control	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
gang	I-ARG
violence	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
continue	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
guns,	I-ARG
regardless	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

control	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
there	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
law	I-ARG
non-abiding	I-ARG

anywhere	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

either	I-ARG

As	O
a	O
result,	O
the	B-ARG
root	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
violence	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
weapon	I-ARG
itself	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
if	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
wants	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
control	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

All	O
in	O
all,	O
it	O

a	I-ARG

We	B-ARG
definitely	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
spend	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
luxurious	I-ARG
custom	I-ARG

just	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

someone,	I-ARG

when	I-ARG
these	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
symbols	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
any	I-ARG

showing	I-ARG

However,	O
the	B-ARG
young	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
it	B-ARG

it	O

to	O
me	O
that	O

an	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
as	B-ARG
people,	I-ARG

teenagers	I-ARG
increasingly	I-ARG
tend	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
focus	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

they	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
lose	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
interests	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
meeting	I-ARG
with	I-ARG

this	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

may	I-ARG
impair	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
continuous	B-ARG

it	B-ARG

harmful	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
us	I-ARG

frequently	I-ARG

Furthermore,	O
the	B-ARG
growing	I-ARG
number	I-ARG

impact	I-ARG

For	O

there	B-ARG

of	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
quite	I-ARG
aggressive	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
nature	I-ARG

In	B-ARG
these	I-ARG

Consequently,	O
frequent	B-ARG
conflicts	I-ARG

we	O

Mobile	B-ARG

has	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
convenience	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
reason	O
is	O
that,	O
as	B-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
telecommunication	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
access	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
internet	I-ARG
via	I-ARG
our	I-ARG

making	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
calls	I-ARG

Thus,	O
mobile	B-ARG
phones	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
shortened	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
distance	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
although	O
mobile	B-ARG
phones	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
faster,	I-ARG
it	B-ARG
also	I-ARG
gives	I-ARG
rise	I-ARG

many	I-ARG

their	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
i	O
highly	O

the	I-ARG

For	O

the	B-ARG

Despite	O
the	O

still	I-ARG
plays	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
vital	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
this	B-ARG
approach	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
basis	I-ARG
tool	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
fields	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
notes,	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
homework	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
writing	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
enables	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
learners'	I-ARG
spelling	I-ARG
capacity	I-ARG

accompany	I-ARG
reading	I-ARG

Under	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
guidance	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
teachers,	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
practicing	I-ARG
handwriting	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
way	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
writing	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
attention	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
content,	I-ARG
elaborate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

and	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
organization	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
parents	O

should	O
give	O
priority	O
on	O
directing	O
their	O
kids	O
about	O
handwriting	O
as	O
poor	B-ARG
handwriting	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
impact	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
performance	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
fact	O
is	O
that	O
kids	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
handwriting	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
difficulties	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
notes	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
catching	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
lessons	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
resulted	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
missing	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
details	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
the	B-ARG
increasing	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
advanced	I-ARG
equipment	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
make	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
lazier	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

For	O

with	B-ARG

It	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
many	B-ARG
poor	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
able	I-ARG

afford	I-ARG
tuition	I-ARG

for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
kids	I-ARG

With	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tax	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
pay,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rich	I-ARG

number	I-ARG

students	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
the	B-ARG
tax	I-ARG
reduction	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
waste	I-ARG

Obviously,	O
this	B-ARG
reduction	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
difficulty	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tax	I-ARG
calculation;	I-ARG
therefore,	O
the	B-ARG
government	I-ARG

recruit	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
greater	I-ARG

this	I-ARG

In	O

the	B-ARG
government	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
salary	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
excessive	I-ARG

this	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
insufficient	I-ARG
investments	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
crucial	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
sectors	I-ARG
such	I-ARG

Many	O

for	O
the	O

claim	O
that	O
such	B-ARG
tax	I-ARG

are	I-ARG
unfair	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG

They	O
point	O
out	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
irrational	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
require	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
taxes	I-ARG
they	I-ARG

Nevertheless,	O
we	B-ARG
also	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG

we	I-ARG
even	I-ARG

We	B-ARG
certainly	I-ARG

On	O
the	O

I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O

I	O

health	I-ARG
budgets	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
precautions	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
first	I-ARG
reason	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
preventative	I-ARG
measures	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
receive	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
greater	I-ARG
budget	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
improvements	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
decreasing	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
patients	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
hospitals	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
healthcare	I-ARG
centers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
managed	I-ARG
effectively	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
treatments	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
current	I-ARG
patients	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
society	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
educated	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
became	I-ARG
aware	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
issues	I-ARG
so	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
potential	I-ARG
precautions	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
illnesses	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
trying	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
treatment	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
increasing	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
patients	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
second	O
reason	O
why	O
governments	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
allocate	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
budget	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
prevention	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
illness	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
providing	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
welfare	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
there	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
nothing	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
human's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
happiness	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
welfare	I-ARG
come	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
a	B-ARG
government's	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
providing	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
illness	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
misery	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG

Fatherhood	O

life	O

from	O
the	O
the	O
birth	O
In	O
today's	O
world,	O
having	O
and	O
raising	O

can	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
difficult	O
task	O
for	O
families,	O
the	O

component	O
of	O
the	O
society	O

While	O
mother's	O
role	O
is	O
essential	O
in	O
a	O
child's	O
life,	O
I	O
completely	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
fatherhood	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
vital	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
healty	I-ARG
parantage	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
motherhood	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
first	I-ARG
reason	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
father's	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
equal	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
mother's	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
nature	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
parantage	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
my	O
view,	O
the	B-ARG
role	I-ARG
models	I-ARG
within	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
significant	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
child's	I-ARG
characteristics	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
Turkish	I-ARG
family,	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
mother	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sincere	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
thoughtful	I-ARG
approach	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
child,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
father	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
must	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
present	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
authoritarian	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
conversative	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
raise	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
well-behaved	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
second	I-ARG
reason	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
believe	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
fatherood	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
motherhood	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
dynamics	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
relationships	I-ARG
today	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
we	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
puts	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
significant	I-ARG
importance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
gender	I-ARG
equality	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
aspect	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
including	I-ARG
relationships	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
a	B-ARG
family	I-ARG
formed	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
woman	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
housewife	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
looks	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
takes	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
man	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
brings	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
seen	I-ARG
anymore	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
today's	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
.	O
Instead,	O
all	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
couple	I-ARG
duties	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
performed	I-ARG
equally	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
interchangeably	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
individuals	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
having	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
raising	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
activity	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
fatherhood	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
present	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
motherhood	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
child's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
starting	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
birth	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
providing	I-ARG
appropriate	I-ARG
parenthood	I-ARG

both	B-ARG

when	B-ARG
you	I-ARG

At	O
the	O

Firstly,	O
children	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
always	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
