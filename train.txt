through	Arg_B

how	Arg_I

how	Arg_I

During	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

On	O
the	O

the	Arg_B

that	Arg_I
how	Arg_I

it	O

the	Arg_I

However,	O
when	Arg_B
we	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

The	O

our	O

the	O
more	O

Take	Arg_B
Olympic	Arg_I
games	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
form	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
competition	Arg_I
for	Arg_I

it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
imagine	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
athlete	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
win	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

without	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
training	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

However	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
they	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
sustain	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I
identities	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
origin	Arg_I
values	Arg_I
.	O
Firstly,	O
maintaining	Arg_B
one’s	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I
identity	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
key	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
rule	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
individuals	Arg_I
emerge	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
multicultural	Arg_I
environments	Arg_I
.	O
Take	Arg_B
Australia	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
example,	Arg_I
immigrants	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
varieties	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
nations	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
called	Arg_I
multicultural	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
where	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
traditional	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
displaying	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
venues	Arg_I
.	O
Many	Arg_B
Australians	Arg_I
come	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
enjoy	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
shows,	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
cultures	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
admire	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
diverse	Arg_I
values	Arg_I
.	O
These	Arg_B
feedbacks,	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
turn,	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
raise	Arg_I
one’s	Arg_I
pride	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
cultures	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
.	O
Thus	O
this	O
makes	O
it	O
clear	O
that	O
sustaining	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I
values	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
immigrants	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
paramount	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
crucial	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
one’s	Arg_I
identity	Arg_I
for	O
they	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
connection	Arg_I
back	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
teach	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
value	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
origin	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
children	Arg_B
immigrated	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
face	Arg_I
social	Arg_I
troubles	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
environment,	Arg_I
parent	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
coming	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
socialize	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
familiar	Arg_I
manner	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
feeling	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
.	O
Fail	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
familiarity	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
felt	Arg_I
isolated,	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
extreme	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
lead	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
social	Arg_I
disorder	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
autism	Arg_I
.	O
Hence,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
keeping	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I
traditions	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
destination	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
tremendous	Arg_I
important	Arg_I

To	O
conclude,	O
although	O
there	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
opposing	Arg_I
ideas	Arg_I

one’s	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I

As	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
concerned,	O
sustaining	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

will	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

the	O

I	O
would	O
contend	O
that	O
it	Arg_B

contributed	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
economic	Arg_I
development	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
preserved	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
environment	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
tourist	Arg_I
destinations	Arg_I
.	O
Firstly,	O
international	Arg_B
tourism	Arg_I
promotes	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
aspects	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
destination	Arg_I
country’s	Arg_I
economy	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
order	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
serve	Arg_I
various	Arg_I
demands	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
tourists	Arg_I
.	O
Take	Arg_B
Cambodia	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
example,	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
large	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
visitors	Arg_I
coming	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
visit	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
Angkowat	Arg_I
ancient	Arg_I
temple	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
services	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
restaurants,	Arg_I
hotels,	Arg_I
souvenir	Arg_I
shops	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
stores	Arg_I
.	O
These	Arg_B
demands	Arg_I
trigger	Arg_I
related	Arg_I
business	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
surrounding	Arg_I
settings	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
turn	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
jobs	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
local	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
infrastructure	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
standard	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore	O
tourism	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
clearly	Arg_I
improved	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
tourist	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
through	Arg_B
tourism	Arg_I
industry,	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I
values	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
preserved	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
natural	Arg_I
environments	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
protected	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
in	Arg_B
Vietnam,	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I
costumes	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
natural	Arg_I
scenes,	Arg_I
namely	Arg_I
‘Trong	Arg_I
Dong’	Arg_I
drum	Arg_I
performance	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
‘Ha	Arg_I
Long’	Arg_I
bay,	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
encouraged	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
preserve	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
funded	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
tourism	Arg_I
ministry	Arg_I
.	O
Without	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
support	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
profit	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
tourism,	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
traditional	Arg_I
cultures	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
disappear	Arg_I
due	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
low	Arg_I
income	Arg_I
works	Arg_I

Thus,	O
tourism	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
survived	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
non-tangible	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I

beauty	Arg_I

To	O
conclude,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O

concerned,	O
international	Arg_B
tourism	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
both	Arg_I
triggered	Arg_I

In	O
my	O

the	Arg_B
most	Arg_I

In	O
the	O

communication	Arg_B

another	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I
particularity	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I

Consideration	Arg_B

always	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
roommate	Arg_B
turns	Arg_I
down	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
music	Arg_I

television	Arg_I
volume	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
night	Arg_I
time	Arg_I

Sometimes	Arg_B
we	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
done	Arg_I
until	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
taste	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
medicine	Arg_I
.	O
At	Arg_B
all	Arg_I
times,	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
other's	Arg_I
feeling	Arg_I
before	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
self-centered	Arg_I

help	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
roommate	Arg_I
relationship	Arg_I
tremendously	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
having	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
considered	Arg_I
roommate	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
significantly	Arg_I
imperative	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
life	Arg_I

It	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I

also	Arg_I

have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
communication	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
making	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
roommate	Arg_I
.	O
People	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
habit	Arg_I

daily	Arg_I

such	Arg_I

tidy	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
morning	Arg_I

One	Arg_B
might	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
piece	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
cake	Arg_I
while	Arg_I
other	Arg_I

it	Arg_I

If	Arg_B
one	Arg_I

Therefore,	O

the	O
ancient	O

There	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
more	Arg_I
we	Arg_I

Additionally,	O
there	Arg_B

a	Arg_I
fact	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
one	Arg_I

with	Arg_I
everyday	Arg_I

if	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

Furthermore,	O
almost	Arg_B
all	Arg_I
natural	Arg_I

financial	Arg_B
sustainability	Arg_I

For	O

the	O

some	O

but	O
I	O
think	O
technology	Arg_B
makes	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
creative	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
technology	Arg_B
inspires	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
.	O
Children	O
are	O
curious	O
about	O
everything	O
around	O
them,	O
so	O
when	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
come	Arg_I
across	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
high-tech	Arg_I
product	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
cellphone,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
obsessed	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
mysterious	Arg_I
functions	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
eager	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
works	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
Bill	Arg_B
Gates	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
attracted	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
original	Arg_I
huge	Arg_I
computer,	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
did	Arg_I
everything	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
worked	Arg_I
.	O
After	Arg_B
he	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
figured	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
stuff,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
began	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
promote	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
computer	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
end,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
successfully	Arg_I
invented	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
computer	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
lightweight	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
instead	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
interfering	Arg_I
children's	Arg_I
creativity,	Arg_I
technology	Arg_I
actually	Arg_I
encourages	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
technology	Arg_B
widen	Arg_I
children's	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
past,	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
were	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
see	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
perspective	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
with	Arg_B
highly	Arg_I
advanced	Arg_I
technology,	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
information	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
communicate	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
they	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
cultures	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
ways	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
thinking	Arg_I
.	O
Knowledge	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
base	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
creativity	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
diverse	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
gained	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
parts	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world,	Arg_I
inspires	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
encourage	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
.	O
Admittedly,	O
technology	Arg_B
may	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I
effects	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
.	O
Technology	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
made	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
children	Arg_I

In	Arg_B
comfortable	Arg_I
conditions,	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
satisfied	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

around	Arg_I
them	Arg_I

refuse	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
development	Arg_I

We	Arg_B
kill	Arg_I

the	Arg_B

First,	O

While	Arg_B
these	Arg_I

If	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

all,	O
a	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

These	Arg_B

not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
many	Arg_I

also	Arg_I

have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
tourism	Arg_B

up	Arg_I
one-third	Arg_I

Czech	Arg_I

In	Arg_B

promote	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
country's	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
Czech	Arg_I

Only	Arg_B

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
modern	Arg_B

Ads	O
will	O
keep	O
us	O
well	O

about	O
new	O
products	O

but	O
we	O
should	O
also	O
bear	O
in	O
mind	O
that	O
advertising	Arg_B
cigarettes	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
alcohol	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
definitely	Arg_I
affect	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I
way	Arg_I

Do	O
married	O
women	O
usually	O
work?	O
Why	O
and	O
why	O
not?	O
Personally,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
married	Arg_B
women	Arg_I
nowadays	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
jobs	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
men	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
employment	Arg_I
discrimination	Arg_I
based	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
gender	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
erased	Arg_I
significantly	Arg_I
.	O
Working	Arg_B
outside	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
bring	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
benefits	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
both	Arg_I
married	Arg_I
woman	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
household	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
will	O
mention	O
some	O
basic	O
reasons	O
as	O
following	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
extra	Arg_B
income	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
women	Arg_I
earn	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
contribute	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
family's	Arg_I
expenses	Arg_I
.	O
By	Arg_B
taking	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
job,	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
wife	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
earn	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
support	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
really	Arg_I
necessary	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
cases	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
husband's	Arg_I
low	Arg_I
salary	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
difficulty	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
getting	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
present	Arg_I
.	O
So,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
normal	Arg_I
practice	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
women	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
helpmates	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
earning	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
working	Arg_B
outside	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
house	Arg_I
creates	Arg_I
opportunities	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
married	Arg_I
women	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
contact	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
outer	Arg_I
world,	Arg_I
strengthen	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
character	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
show	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
capacity	Arg_I
.	O
These	Arg_B
things	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
turn	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
confident,	Arg_I
independent	Arg_I
.	O
These	Arg_B
women	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
set	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
example	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
doubt	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
play	Arg_I
roles	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
mother	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
wife	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
nowadays,	O
there	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
supporting	Arg_I
conditions	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
women	Arg_I
balance	Arg_I
housework	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
.	O
Besides	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
gorvernment's	Arg_I
policies	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
limited	Arg_I
families	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
husbands'	Arg_I
sharing	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
housework,	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
employers	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
willing	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
offer	Arg_I
part-time	Arg_I
jobs	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
women	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
a	Arg_B
well-organized	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
does	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
housewife's	Arg_I
presence	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
whole	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
long	Arg_I
and	O
married	Arg_B
women	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
order	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
enjoy	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
outside	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
home	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

In	O
the	O

I	Arg_B
don't	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
fair	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
pay	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
students'	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
all	Arg_I

in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
receive	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
education	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
students	Arg_B
that	Arg_I
already	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
basic	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
part-time	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
pay	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
studies	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parent	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
afford	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
pay	Arg_I
it	Arg_I

They	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
responsible	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
studies	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
pay	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
fees	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I

In	O
addition	O
to	O
that,	O
the	Arg_B
students	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
independent	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
build	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
characters	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O
this	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
strongly	O
agree	O
that	O
alternative	Arg_B
means	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
international	Arg_I
laws	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
controlling	Arg_I
automobiles	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
introduced	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
this	O
essay,	O
several	O
reasons	O
will	O
be	O
described	O
carefully	O
in	O
the	O
following	O
passages	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
an	Arg_B
increase	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
automobiles	Arg_I
brings	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
environmental	Arg_I
pollution	Arg_I
.	O
Since	O
automobile	O
exhaust	O
and	O
carbon	O
dioxides	O
emission	O
have	O
bad	O
impacts	O
on	O
the	O
air,	O
the	Arg_B
air	Arg_I
gets	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
polluted	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
causes	Arg_I
respiratory	Arg_I
disease	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
local	Arg_I
inhabitants	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
crucial	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
alter	Arg_I
automobiles	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
legislate	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
control	Arg_I
automobiles	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
an	Arg_B
increase	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
automobiles	Arg_I
causes	Arg_I
terrible	Arg_I
traffic	Arg_I
congestion	Arg_I
.	O
Once	Arg_B
we	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
traffic	Arg_I
jam,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
forces	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
waste	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
while	Arg_I
.	O
What	O
is	O
worse,	O
traffic	Arg_B
congestion	Arg_I
irritates	Arg_I
drivers	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
result,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
leads	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
traffic	Arg_I
accidents	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
the	Arg_B
methods	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
reduce	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
automobiles	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
control	Arg_I
car	Arg_I
ownership	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
immediately	Arg_I
planned	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
implemented	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
order	O
to	O
solve	O
these	O
problems,	O
alternative	Arg_B
forms	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
international	Arg_I
laws	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
control	Arg_I
automobiles	Arg_I
ownership	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
effectively	Arg_I
.	O
With	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
former,	O
alternative	Arg_B
forms	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
emit	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
carbon	Arg_I
dioxides	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
gasses	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
automobiles	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
ideal	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
rental	Arg_B
bicycle	Arg_I
system	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
introduced	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
European	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
system	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
corner	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
district,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
rental	Arg_I
bicycles	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
placed	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
ride	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
districts	Arg_I
with	Arg_I

Advertising	Arg_B
also	Arg_I
helps	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
prices	Arg_I

reasonable	Arg_I
levels,	Arg_I
creates	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
fair	Arg_I
environment	Arg_I

Otherwise	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
power	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
advertising	Arg_I
maybe	Arg_I
over-rated,	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
deny	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

No	O

how	O

Gun	O
control	O
Gun	O
is	O
definitely	O
not	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
normal	O
good	O
in	O
our	O
society,	O
which	O
is	O
strictly	O
controlled	O
in	O
most	O
countries	O
.	O
However,	O
gun	O
control	O
in	O
some	O
countries	O
is	O
relatively	O
loose	O
than	O
others	O
.	O
Therefore,	O
this	O
is	O
still	O
a	O
controversial	O
topic	O
around	O
the	O
world	O
.	O
From	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
sensible	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
enforce	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
gun	Arg_I
control	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
first	O
factor	O
considered	O
is	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
accidents	O
with	O
guns	O
.	O
The	Arg_B
accidents	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
completely	Arg_I
avoided	Arg_I
although	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
gun	Arg_I
licenses	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
purchase	Arg_I
guns	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
we	Arg_B
hear	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
news	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
someone	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
hurt	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
accident	Arg_I
during	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
hunting	Arg_I
.	O
So	O
the	Arg_B
fewer	Arg_I
guns	Arg_I
possessed,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
fewer	Arg_I
accidents	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
happened,	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
surroundings	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
safer	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
lower	Arg_I
accident	Arg_I
rates	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
most	Arg_B
violent	Arg_I
crimes	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
related	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
abuse	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
guns,	Arg_I
especially	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
where	Arg_I
guns	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
available	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
.	O
Eventually,	O
guns	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
violent	Arg_I
society	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
trend	Arg_I
continues	Arg_I
.	O
Take	O
an	O
example,	O
in	Arg_B
American,	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
adults	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
juveniles	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
access	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
guns,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
leads	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
tragedies	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
gun	Arg_I
shooting	Arg_I
.	O
What	O
is	O
worse,	O
some	Arg_B
terrorists	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
possess	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
advanced	Arg_I
weapons	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
police,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
citizens	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
live	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
danger	Arg_I
.	O
Thirdly,	O
the	Arg_B
possession	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
guns	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
raise	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
rates	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
suicide	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
US,	Arg_I
firearms	Arg_I
remain	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
common	Arg_I
method	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
suicide,	Arg_I
accounting	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
50	Arg_I
per	Arg_I
cent	Arg_I
.	O
Unfortunately,	O
there	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
increasing	Arg_I
trend	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
adolescent	Arg_I
suicides	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
suicides	Arg_I
among	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
age	Arg_I
75	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
over	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
considering	O
the	O
rise	O
in	O
accident	O
rates,	O
violent	O
crime	O
rates	O
and	O
suicide	O
rates,	O
I	O
support	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
guns	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
strictly	Arg_I
limited	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
enforce	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
series	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
laws	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prevent	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
societies	Arg_I

In	O

that	Arg_B

a	O

Moreover,	O

Secondly,	O
students	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
take	Arg_I

Also,	O
working	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
independency	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

With	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
they	Arg_I

from	Arg_I
extra	Arg_I
jobs,	Arg_I

normally	Arg_I

not	Arg_I
much,	Arg_I
those	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
that	Arg_B

that	O
international	Arg_B

the	O
nuclear	O
and	O
solar	O
which	O
are	O
abundant	O
and	O
eco-friendly	O
.	O
I	O
will	O
analyze	O
these	O
areas	O
in	O
the	O
essay	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
the	Arg_B
major	Arg_I
source	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
today	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
water	Arg_I
.	O
Although	O
there	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
water	Arg_I
shortage	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
generate	Arg_I
electricity	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
rely	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
source	Arg_I
.	O
To	Arg_B
generate	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
vast	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
fundamental	Arg_I
resources	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
falling	Arg_I
short	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
during	Arg_B
summer	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
power	Arg_I
cut	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
developing	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
India	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
encourage	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
nuclear,	Arg_I
solar	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
wind	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
might	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
problem	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
distributing	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
required	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
electricity	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
it	Arg_B
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
implication	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
generate	Arg_I
electricity	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
available	Arg_I
sources	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
the	Arg_B
sources	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
widely	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
currently	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
generate	Arg_I
power	Arg_I
releases	Arg_I
extensive	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
gases	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
atmosphere	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
increases	Arg_I
global	Arg_I
warming	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
the	Arg_B
use	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
solar	Arg_I
cooker	Arg_I
instead	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
electric	Arg_I
cooker	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
certainly	Arg_I
reduce	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
global	Arg_I
warming	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
the	O
same	O
way,	O
the	Arg_B
use	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
nuclear	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
alternative	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
hydro-kinetic	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
causes	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
atmospheric	Arg_I
pollution	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
it	Arg_B
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
implication	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
promote	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
sources	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
available	Arg_I
natural	Arg_I
resources	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
turn	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
reduce	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
global	Arg_I
warming	Arg_I
.	O
Further,	O
government	O
should	O
motivate	O
and	O
encourage	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
use	O
alternative	O
sources	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
solar	O
and	O
the	O
nuclear	O
energy	O
.	O

Should	O
governments	O
be	O
responsible	O
to	O
help	O
the	O
unemployed	O

Unemployment	O
is	O
clearly	O
a	O
global	O
problem,	O
be	O
it	O
in	O
developed	O
countries	O
or	O
developing	O

However,	O
I	O
tend	O
to	O
believe	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
responsibility	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
disadvantaged	Arg_I
citizens,	Arg_I
rather	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
government,	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
out	Arg_I

Government	Arg_B
money	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
spent	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
publicly	Arg_I
beneficial	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
.	O
Tax	Arg_B
revenue	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
collected	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
works	Arg_I
.	O
Spending	Arg_B
them	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
helping	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
make	Arg_I

would	Arg_I

fair	Arg_I

Besides,	O
there	O
are	O
other	O
pressing	O
demands	O
on	O
the	O
government	O
expenditure,	O
such	O
as	O
health	O

and	O

so	O
addressing	Arg_B
unemployment	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
low	Arg_I
priority	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
it	O
is	O
obvious	O
that,	O
to	Arg_B
survive	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
competitive	Arg_I
world,	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
equip	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
well	Arg_I

If	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
free	Arg_I
financial	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
government,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
might	Arg_I

out	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
motivation	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
all	Arg_I

Of	O
course,	O
this	Arg_B
does	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
mean	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
leave	Arg_I
alone	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
assistance	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
already	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
reverse	Arg_I
circumstances	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
rather	Arg_I
difficult	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
overcome	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
difficulties	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
external	Arg_I
support	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
this	O
case,	O
the	Arg_B
government	Arg_I
ought	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
set	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
free	Arg_I
vocational	Arg_I
trainings	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
provide	Arg_I
interest-free	Arg_I

them,	Arg_I

After	O
all,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
beneficial	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
society	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

that	O
these	Arg_B

Anyone	Arg_B

In	O
this	O

my	O
opinion	O
for	O
both	O

It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
obvious	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
power	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
positively	Arg_I
influence	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
human	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
psychology	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
many	Arg_B
university	Arg_I
authorities	Arg_I
provide	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
lessons	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
so	O
that	O
they	Arg_B
live	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
harmony	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
have	O
an	O
impression	O
that	O
students,	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
deal	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I
subjects	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
opportunity	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
cope	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
gained	Arg_I
during	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
this	O
case,	O
music	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
useful	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
interesting	Arg_I
solution	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
if	Arg_B
musical	Arg_I
activity	Arg_I
involves	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
participants,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
co-operation	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
developed	Arg_I
team	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
group,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is,	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
course,	Arg_I
beneficial	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
students	Arg_B
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
quite	Arg_I
poor	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I
background	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
show	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
.	O
Consequently,	O
the	Arg_B
calm	Arg_I
atmosphere	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
might	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
created	Arg_I
.	O
By	O
contrast,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
clear	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
mentally	Arg_I
enhancing	Arg_I
effects	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
our	O
hectic	O
life,	O
however,	O
demand	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
musically	Arg_I
orientated	Arg_I
students,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
academically	Arg_I
developed	Arg_I
employees	Arg_I
.	O
Hence,	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
majority,	O
because	O
music	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
requires	Arg_I
special	Arg_I
attitude	Arg_I
towards	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
.	O
Increasingly	O
however,	O
students	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
obtain	Arg_I
supposed	Arg_I
impacts,	Arg_I
unless	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
interested	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
seriously	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
music	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
entertaining	Arg_I
subjects	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
optional	Arg_I
.	O
Nowadays,	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
thing	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
increased	Arg_I
pace	Arg_I

To	O
my	O
mind,	O
students	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
develop	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
professional	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
occupation-related	Arg_I

In	O
my	O
opinion	O
universities	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
invest	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
libraries	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
anywhere	Arg_I
else	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
I	O
think	O
a	Arg_B
library	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
vital	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
strategical	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
.	O
All	Arg_B
professors	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
modern	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
well-equipped	Arg_I
library	Arg_I
because,	O
after	Arg_B
internet,	Arg_I
library	Arg_I
plays	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
role	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
research	Arg_I
.	O
Although	O
sport	O
is	O
important,	O
it	Arg_B
does	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
priority	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
library	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition	O
only	Arg_B
small	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
sport	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	Arg_B
my	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
library	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
sports	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
usually	Arg_B
libraries	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
income	Arg_I
.	O
Most	Arg_B
libraries	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
free	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
.	O
Hence,	O
universities	Arg_B
support	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
vital	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
libraries	Arg_I
.	O
But	O
sport	Arg_B
activities	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
income	Arg_I
because	O
every	Arg_B
sport	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
matches	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
match	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
sponsors	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
they	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
sell	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
matches	Arg_I
tickets	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
there	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
ways	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
sports	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
compensate	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
expenses,	Arg_I

it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
for	Arg_I

to	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
income	Arg_I
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
investing	Arg_B

libraries	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
long-time	Arg_I
result	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
a	Arg_B
library	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
buy	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
books	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
buy	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
computers	Arg_I
.	O
Most	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
library	Arg_I
facilities	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
stable	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
long	Arg_I
time	Arg_I

Besides,	O
in	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

On	O
the	O

most	Arg_B

two	O

ones	O

The	O
first	O
and	O
foremost	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
with	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
development	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
science	Arg_I

technology,	Arg_I
more	Arg_I

cook	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
short	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
people	Arg_B
nowadays	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
hour	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
meal	Arg_I
instead	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
two,	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
three	Arg_I
hours	Arg_I

in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
last	Arg_I
10	Arg_I
years	Arg_I

Actually,	O
in	Arg_B
recent	Arg_I
years,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
significant	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
all	Arg_I

life	Arg_I
realizing	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
benefit	Arg_I

those	Arg_I

doing	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

And	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
figure	Arg_I
still	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
improvement	Arg_I

it	Arg_B

certain	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
spending	Arg_I
less	Arg_I

be	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
main	Arg_I
trend	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
near	Arg_I
future	Arg_I

Another	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
most	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
prefer	Arg_I

have	Arg_I
meals	Arg_I

they	Arg_B

According	O
to	O
a	O
recent	O
survey,	O
89%	Arg_B
of	Arg_I

been	Arg_I
put	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
situation	Arg_I

have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
hard,	Arg_I

all	Arg_I

so	Arg_I
on	Arg_I

Thus,	O
they	Arg_B
find	Arg_I

cook	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
meal	Arg_I

Even	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
spare	Arg_I
time,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
prefer	Arg_I

go	Arg_I
out	Arg_I

relax	Arg_I

relieve	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
pressure	Arg_I

Some	O
people	O
may	O
argue	O
that	O
investing	Arg_B
much	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
cooking	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
guarantee	Arg_I

quality	Arg_I

food	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
some	O
extent,	O
it	O
is	O
true	O

However,	O
as	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
matter	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
fact,	Arg_I
using	Arg_I
technology	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
advanced	Arg_I
facilities	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
lose	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
nutrition	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I

Even,	O
with	O
the	O
help	O

bacterias,	O
mold	O
spores,	O
or	O
pesticide	O
in	O
vegetables,	O
fruits	O

be	O
killed	O

removed,	O
thus	O
health	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
eaters	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
assured	Arg_I

Besides,	O
along	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
high	Arg_I

requirements	Arg_I

Consequently,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
quite	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
nutritious	Arg_I

there	Arg_B

Taking	Arg_B

suffer	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
disease	Arg_I

more	Arg_I
urgent	Arg_I

As	O
a	O

of	O
fact,	O
an	Arg_B
uneducated	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
barely	Arg_I
appreciate	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
providing	Arg_B

more	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I

condition	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
competition	Arg_I
among	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
facilities	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
inevitable	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
free	Arg_I
market,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
interfered	Arg_I
by	Arg_I

Instead,	O
the	Arg_B
establishment	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
medical	Arg_I
facilities	Arg_I

educational	Arg_I

aimed	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
standard	Arg_I
rather	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
earning	Arg_I
profits,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
deserves	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
funds	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
.	O
Furthermore,	O
putting	Arg_B
taxpayers'	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
building	Arg_I
theaters	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
sports	Arg_I

is	Arg_I
unfair	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
who	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
it	Arg_B

a	Arg_I

the	O

In	Arg_B

In	Arg_B

This	Arg_B

In	O

many	Arg_B

On	O
the	O

some	Arg_B

a	Arg_I
detrimental	Arg_I
effect	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

They	O
argue	O
that	O

are	Arg_I
crazier	Arg_I
about	Arg_I

becoming	Arg_I
indifferent	Arg_I

But	O
I	O
believe	O
this	O

the	O
issue	O

I	Arg_B
agree	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
pictures	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
influence	Arg_I

nowadays	Arg_B

As	O
a	O
result,	O
statistics	Arg_B
show	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
slight	Arg_I
reduction	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
smokers,	Arg_I
indicating	Arg_I
that	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I

Not	O
only	O
that,	O
the	Arg_B
magnificent	Arg_I

captured	Arg_I

Kevin	Arg_I
Carter,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
portrayed	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
starving	Arg_I
Sudanese	Arg_I
child	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

Apart	O

that,	O

Thus,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
undeniable	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
images	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
absence	Arg_I
of	Arg_I

can	Arg_I
obviously	Arg_I
claim	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

of	Arg_I
many	Arg_I

Looking	O
from	O
another	O
perspective,	O
written	Arg_B
words	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
vital	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
order	Arg_I

spread	Arg_I

certain	Arg_I

With	Arg_B
only	Arg_I
pictures,	Arg_I
everyone	Arg_I

own	Arg_I
interpretation	Arg_I

how	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
perceive	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
images	Arg_I

Nonetheless,	O
this	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
words	Arg_I

used	Arg_I

explain	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

about	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O
the	Arg_B
primary	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
educating	Arg_I

also	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
way	Arg_I

Academic	Arg_B
textbooks	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
days	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
readers	Arg_I

comprehend	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
both	Arg_B
images	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
words	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
hand	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
hand	Arg_I

First	O

it	Arg_B

that	Arg_I

these	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

What	O

more,	O
it	Arg_B

On	O
the	O

Although	O

As	O
evidence	O
of	O
this,	O
there	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
few	Arg_I
people,	Arg_I

do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I

those	Arg_I

These	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

In	Arg_B

From	O

Admittedly,	O
some	Arg_B

may	Arg_I
place	Arg_I

ahead	Arg_I

Besides,	O
people	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

In	O
this	O

the	Arg_B

conflicting	Arg_I

However,	O
I	O
believe	O
the	Arg_B

With	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

For	O

electronic	Arg_B

Furthermore,	O
taking	Arg_B

If	Arg_B
a	Arg_I

lines	Arg_I

boost	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
it	Arg_B

spur	Arg_I

On	O
the	O

hand,	O
without	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
requirement	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

would	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
consume	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

constitutes	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
large	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

supplying	Arg_B

Even	O
so,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
CCTV	Arg_B

should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
installed	Arg_I

every	Arg_I
premise	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
combat	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

protect	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
by	Arg_B
having	Arg_I
CCTV	Arg_I
cameras	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
workplace,	Arg_I
crimes	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
robbery	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
trimmed	Arg_I
down	Arg_I
.	O
This	O
is	O
because	O
when	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
shop	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
attacked	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
thieves,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
clips	Arg_I
taken	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
cameras	Arg_I
serve	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
source	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
evidence	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
thieves	Arg_I

be	Arg_I
traced	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
illustrate	O
this	O
further,	O
in	Arg_B
Malaysia,	Arg_I
policemen	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
videos	Arg_I
captured	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
CCTV	Arg_I
cameras	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
trace	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
successfully	Arg_I
catch	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
robbers	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
broke	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
Seven	Arg_I
Eleven	Arg_I
shop	Arg_I
during	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
midnight	Arg_I
.	O
Not	O
only	O
that,	O
as	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
employees	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I

they	Arg_I

less	Arg_I

steal	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

.	O
Thus,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
CCTVs	Arg_B
must	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
put	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
workplace	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
crime	Arg_I
rates	Arg_I

be	Arg_I
minimized	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O
at	Arg_B
some	Arg_I
offices,	Arg_I

often	Arg_I

handle	Arg_I

At	O
times,	O
face-to-face	Arg_B

an	Arg_I

physical	Arg_I

Hence,	O
the	Arg_B
installation	Arg_I

may	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

In	O
the	O

the	Arg_B

what	Arg_I
actually	Arg_I
took	Arg_I

further	Arg_I
actions	Arg_I

be	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
taken	Arg_I

In	O
short,	O
these	Arg_B

can	Arg_I
help	Arg_I

provide	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
form	Arg_I

Looking	O
from	O
another	O
perspective,	O
the	O
use	O

does	O
cause	O
controversy	O

Those	Arg_B
opposing	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
CCTV	Arg_I
systems	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
privacies	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
invaded	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
constant	Arg_I
monitoring	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

However,	O
one	Arg_B

Ergo,	O

victims	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
crime	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
CCTV	Arg_B
cameras	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
therefore	Arg_I
must	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
installed	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
every	Arg_I

This	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

Nonetheless,	O

In	O

Some	O

of	O
them	O

rate	O

increasing	O
population	O

and	O
animals	O

From	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
although	O
endangered	O
animals	O
are	O
important,	O
human	Arg_B
needs	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
considered	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
.	O
Firstly,	O
day	O
by	O
day	O
population	O
is	O
increasing,	O
so	O
human	Arg_B
needs	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
increasing	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
.	O
We	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
farmland	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
grow	Arg_I
crops	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
wheat	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
corn,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
doubt	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
alive	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
weeks	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
farmlands	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
vital	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
human	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
people	O
need	O
shelters	O
to	O
protect	O
themselves	O
from	O
mother	O
nature	O
such	O
as	O
wind	O
and	O
flood	O
and	O
wild	O
animals,	O
so	O
they	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
land	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
build	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
houses	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
.	O
Dwelling	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
human	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
undeniable	Arg_I
.	O
Finally,	O
human	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
crucial	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
continue	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
life,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
industrial	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
medicine	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
some	Arg_B
lands	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
assigned	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
industry	Arg_I
.	O
Todays	Arg_B
life	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
difficulty	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
comfortable	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
industry	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
the	O
population	O
of	O
endangered	O
animals	O
are	O
less	O
than	O
people's	O
population,	O
so	O
they	Arg_B
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
land	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
would	O
maintain	O
that	O
nowadays	Arg_B
humans	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
farmland,	Arg_I
housing	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
industry	Arg_I
because	O
of	O
increasing	Arg_B
population	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
saving	Arg_I
land	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
endangered	Arg_I
animals	Arg_I

This	O

For	O

take	Arg_B
a	Arg_I

anyone	Arg_I

The	Arg_B

punishment	Arg_B

a	Arg_B

Thus,	O
exposing	Arg_B
them	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

With	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

Firstly,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
known	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
clinically	Arg_I
proven	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
smoking	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
extremely	Arg_I
hazardous	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
smoker	Arg_I

others	Arg_I

period	Arg_I

death	Arg_I
statistic	Arg_I
released	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
Malaysian	Arg_I
Ministry	Arg_I
of	Arg_I

shows	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
top	Arg_I
killer	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
lung	Arg_I
related	Arg_I
diseases	Arg_I
caused	Arg_I
by	Arg_I

A	Arg_B
large	Arg_I
proportion	Arg_I

involved	Arg_I
second	Arg_I
hand	Arg_I
smoker	Arg_I
particularly	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
children	Arg_I

pregnant	Arg_I
women	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
were	Arg_I
vulnerable	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
lethal	Arg_I
diseases	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
the	Arg_B
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
fatality	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
significantly	Arg_I
reduced	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
total	Arg_I
ban	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
the	Arg_B
image	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
healthy	Arg_I
nation	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
promoted	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
restricts	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
smoking	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
imposing	Arg_I
stern	Arg_I
penalty	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
offender	Arg_I

For	O
instance,	O
the	Arg_B
Brunei	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
recently	Arg_I
enforced	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
law	Arg_I
against	Arg_I
smoking	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
areas	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
cafés,	Arg_I
hospital	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
shopping	Arg_I
street	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
step	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
curbed	Arg_I
down	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
numbers	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
smokers	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
result,	Arg_I
Brunei	Arg_I
remains	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
place	Arg_I
known	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
tranquility	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
cleanliness	Arg_I

This	Arg_B
example	Arg_I
shows	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
benefit	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
restricting	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
smoking	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
country	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
whole	Arg_I

To	O
sum	O
up,	O
the	Arg_B
effort	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prohibit	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
smoking	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
public	Arg_I

To	O

it,	O

Lastly,	O
either	Arg_B

Another	O

This	Arg_B

In	O

the	Arg_B

Taking	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

another	Arg_B

Taxes	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

every	Arg_I
country	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

they	Arg_I

If	Arg_B

In	O
fact,	O
in	Arg_B

In	O
this	O

the	Arg_B

Taking	O
everything	O

the	Arg_I

There	Arg_B

several	Arg_I

be	Arg_I
banned	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
the	Arg_B

animals	Arg_B

Recent	Arg_B
studies	Arg_I

out	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
animals	Arg_I

In	Arg_B
March	Arg_I
2003,	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lab	Arg_I
technician	Arg_I
shot	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

inside	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lab,	Arg_I

revealed	Arg_I
primates	Arg_I

Consequently,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
sacrificing	Arg_B

an	Arg_I
expensive	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
painful	Arg_I
activity	Arg_I

the	O
argument	O
that	O
many	O
ethical	O

genetic	O

broken	O
when	O

inhumane	O

also	O
misleading,	O
since	O
animals	Arg_B

a	Arg_I

I	O

that	O
human	Arg_B

have	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
moral	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
use	Arg_I

For	O
the	O

it	Arg_B

that	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
in	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

On	O

that,	O
poorer	Arg_B

To	O
solve	O
these	O

richer	Arg_B

these	Arg_I

as	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
in	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
area	Arg_I

it	Arg_I

Besides	O
that,	O
education	Arg_B
for	Arg_I
these	Arg_I

In	O
order	O

the	O

richer	Arg_B

for	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

in	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

poorer	Arg_I

For	O

As	O
a	O

richer	Arg_B

provide	Arg_I
financial	Arg_I

to	Arg_I
poorer	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
encourage	Arg_I

The	Arg_B

In	O
conclusion,	O
richer	Arg_B

However,	O
I	Arg_B
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
agree	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
explosion	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
technology	Arg_I

'innovate'	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

There	O
are	O
several	O
reasons	O
why	O
teachers	O
will	O
never	O
be	O
replaced	O
by	O
computers	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
computers	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
operated	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
.	O
No	Arg_B
one	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
argue	Arg_I
that	Arg_I

tools	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
must-haves	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
classroom	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
today	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
lessons	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
attractive	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
easier	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
put	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

presentation	Arg_I

then	Arg_I
presented	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
LCD	Arg_I

However,	O
scientists	Arg_B
prove	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
classroom	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I
trained	Arg_I
staff	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
interactive	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
innovative	Arg_I
ways	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
teaching	Arg_I

I	O
agree	O
that	O
nowadays	O
the	O
learning	O

benefits	O
greatly	O
from	O
computers,	O
but	O
they	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
just	Arg_I

cannot	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
properly	Arg_I

human's	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
children	Arg_B

human	Arg_I
interactions	Arg_I

No	Arg_B
matter	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
advanced	Arg_I
technology	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
clear	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
computer	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
never	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
communicate	Arg_I

the	O
founder	O

human	O

'This	O

there	Arg_B
can	Arg_I

no	Arg_I

I	O

that	O

by	Arg_I

they	Arg_I

this	O

reasons	O

The	O
main	O
reason	O
why	O
I	O
believe	O
artists	O
should	O
be	O
funded	O
is	O
because	O
art	Arg_B
helps	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
monuments	Arg_B
that	Arg_I
represent	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
city	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
illustrate	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
city's	Arg_I
history	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
culture,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
city	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
beautiful	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
attractive	Arg_I
place	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
tourists	Arg_I

In	O
fact,	O
some	O
countries	O
depend	O
on	O
tourism	O
as	O
their	O
main	O
source	O
of	O
revenue,	O
thus,	O
the	Arg_B
governments	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
arts	Arg_I
because	O
their	Arg_B
work	Arg_I
crafts	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
necessary	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
boost	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
tourist	Arg_I

In	O
addition,	O
sculptures	Arg_B

paintings	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
museums	Arg_I

art	Arg_I
galleries	Arg_I
generally	Arg_I
reflect	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I

civilization	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
generation	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
culture	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
history	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
reserved	Arg_I

assured	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
art	Arg_I

Young	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
are	Arg_I

able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
country's	Arg_I
history	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
observing	Arg_I
various	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
crafts	Arg_I
.	O
Another	O
reason	O
why	O
artists	O
should	O
be	O
helped	O
is	O
because	O
talent	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
extremely	Arg_I
precious	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
wasted	Arg_I

Indeed,	O
not	Arg_B
many	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
blessed	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
talent	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
paintings	Arg_I

work	Arg_I
crafts	Arg_I

Hence,	O
this	Arg_B
type	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
talent	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
valued	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
types	Arg_I
of	Arg_I

such	Arg_I

talent	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
science	Arg_I

To	O
sum	O
up,	O
art	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
valuable	O
object	O
for	O
every	O
country	O
and	O
the	O
talent	O
in	O
this	O
area	O

so	O
I	O
think	O
governments	Arg_B

continue	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

First	O
of	O
all,	O
some	O

claim	O
that	O

For	O

hardly	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

"murdering"	Arg_B

First	O

all,	O
it	O

that	O
every	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
right	Arg_I

live	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
no	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
capital	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

to	Arg_I
control	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I

just	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
in	Arg_B

a	Arg_I

life	Arg_I
with	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
third	Arg_I
reason	Arg_I
why	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
death	Arg_I

should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
banned	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

Thus,	O
many	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
crime	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
did	Arg_I

In	O
conclusion,	O
although	O

an	O

the	O

I	O
firmly	O

it	O

However,	O
I	Arg_B
completely	Arg_I
disagree	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
idea	Arg_I
that	Arg_I

should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
allowed	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
anything	Arg_I
they	Arg_I

With	Arg_B
this	Arg_I

damage	Arg_I
everything	Arg_I

just	Arg_I
making	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
profit	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
if	Arg_B
there	Arg_I

not	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
control	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

they	Arg_I

permitted	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
everything	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
want,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
threaten	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
beings'	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
human,	Arg_I

As	Arg_B
every	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
read	Arg_I

hear	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
factories	Arg_I
hit	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

by	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
toxic	Arg_I
substances	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
if	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
do	O
anything	O
they	O
can	O
to	O
just	O
make	O
a	O
profit,	O
they	O
will	O
produce	O
products	O

low	O

high	O

therefore	O
they	Arg_B
might	Arg_I
hit	Arg_I
consumer's	Arg_I
life	Arg_I

For	O
instance,	O
a	Arg_B
few	Arg_I
months	Arg_I
ago	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
was	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

In	O
conclusion,	O
all	Arg_B

The	Arg_B

The	Arg_B

pretty	Arg_I
old	Arg_I

they	Arg_I

I	O
really	O

that	O
the	Arg_B

Their	Arg_B
old	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
pretty	Arg_I
old	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
educational	Arg_I
materials,	Arg_I
repairing	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

for	Arg_I

Also	O
the	O
laboratory	O

the	Arg_B

They	Arg_B

new	Arg_I
breath	Arg_I

great	Arg_I
enthusiasm	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
school	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
the	Arg_B
new	Arg_I
high	Arg_I

will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
place	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
connections	Arg_I

different	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
city	Arg_I
.	O
After	Arg_B
classes	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
together	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
building	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
high	Arg_I

after	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
competition	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
touch	Arg_I

This	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
social	Arg_I
connections	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
only	Arg_I
disadvantage	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
noisiness	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
competitions	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
people	O
living	O
in	O
the	O

be	O
a	O
bit	O

but	O
I	O
think	O
this	Arg_B
isn't	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
reason	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
ceasing	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
competitions	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
this	Arg_B
new	Arg_I
construction	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
advantages	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
connections	Arg_I
between	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
communities,	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
educational	Arg_I

will	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students'	Arg_I
enthusiasm	Arg_I

The	O
only	O
disadvantage	O
is	O
the	O
nosiness	O
of	O

but	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
it	Arg_B
isn't	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
big	Arg_I

So	O
the	Arg_B
new	Arg_I

They	O

if	Arg_B

with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

As	O
a	O

I	Arg_B

large	Arg_I

this	Arg_I
age,	Arg_I

I	Arg_I
almost	Arg_I
traveled	Arg_I

when	Arg_I
I	Arg_I

Also	O
I	Arg_B

All	O
in	O
all,	O
I	O

the	Arg_B

They	Arg_B

whatever	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
any	Arg_I

also	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I

have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I

Concentrate	O
on	O
the	O
objectives	O
-	O
people	O
attend	O
schools	O
for	O
various	O
reasons	O
From	O
many	O
centuries	O
ago,	O
universities	O
have	O
been	O
playing	O
an	O
important	O
role	O
in	O
ones'	O
life	O

Different	O
people	O
attend	O
university	O
for	O
different	O
point	O
of	O
views	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
perspective,	O
the	Arg_B
three	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
reasons	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
increased	Arg_I
knowledge,	Arg_I
career	Arg_I
preparation	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
experiences	Arg_I
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
for	Arg_B
most	Arg_I
people,	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
ideal	Arg_I
place	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
develop	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
understanding	Arg_I
.	O
Truthfully,	O
in	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
wonderful	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I
environment,	Arg_I
everyone	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
provided	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
varieties	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
gigantic	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
information	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
professors	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
well-trained	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
people	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
strengthen	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
through	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
instructions	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
teachers,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
sufficient	Arg_I
infrastructure	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
laboratory,	Arg_I
library,	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
capable	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
research	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I
aspect	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
they	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
gain	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
deep	Arg_I
sight	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
studying	O
in	O
university	O
means	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
totally	O
turned	O
into	O
a	O
different	O
page	O
of	O
your	O
life,	O
which	O
included	O
many	O
new	O
experiences	O
.	O
The	Arg_B
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
individual	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
enroll	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
enormous,	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
studied	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
students	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
given	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
fantastic	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
wide	Arg_I
relationships	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
corner	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
nation,	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
whole	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
my	Arg_B
brother	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
international	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
mixed	Arg_I
community	Arg_I
include	Arg_I
Vietnam,	Arg_I
Brazil,	Arg_I
Argentina,	Arg_I
etc	Arg_I
.	O
And	Arg_B
he	Arg_I
told	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
excited	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
experiencing	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
environment,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
main	Arg_I
purposes	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
attending	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
preparing	Arg_B
for	Arg_I
career	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I
function	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
.	O
Students	Arg_B
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
homework,	Arg_I
assignment	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
participate	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
volunteer	Arg_I
work,	Arg_I
internship	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
they	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
experiences	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
outside	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
discover	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
goals	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
.	O
After	O
all,	O
they	Arg_B
know	Arg_I
where	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
put	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
emphasis	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
order	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
achieve	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
objectives	Arg_I

In	O
summation,	O
people	O
may	O

various	O
reasons	O

Some	O

everybody	Arg_B
who	Arg_I

studying	Arg_I

should	Arg_I
concentrate	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

People	Arg_B
are	Arg_I

focus	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
making	Arg_I
wealth	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
progress	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

The	O
life	O

however	O
it	O
also	O
deprives	O
of	O
some	O
things	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
life	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
old	Arg_I
days	Arg_I
brings	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
happiness	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
today	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
reasons	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
first	O
reason	O
is	O
life	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
simple	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
past	Arg_I
.	O
Nowadays,	Arg_B
all	Arg_I
humans	Arg_I
compete	Arg_I
together	Arg_I
.	O
Since	O
world	O
population	O
getting	O
higher,	O
competition	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
getting	Arg_I
fierce	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
handle	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
jobs,	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
someone	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
replace	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
away	Arg_I
.	O
People	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
put	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
effort	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
condition	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
lives	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
old	Arg_I
days	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
easier	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
today	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
the	Arg_B
environment	Arg_I
today	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
serious	Arg_I
damaged	Arg_I
.	O
Looking	Arg_B
out	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
windows,	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
see	Arg_I
isn't	Arg_I
sky,	Arg_I
trees	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
mountains,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
coldly	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
buildings	Arg_I
.	O
Everyday,	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
walk	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
roads,	Arg_I
breath	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
polluted	Arg_I
air,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
live	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
limited	Arg_I
space	Arg_I
.	O
What's	O
worse,	O
it	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
proved	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
kind	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
condition	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
result	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
mental	Arg_I
diseases	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
the	Arg_B
environment	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
grandparents	Arg_I
live	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
comfortable	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
today	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
third	Arg_I
reason	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
pace	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
Today,	O
we	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
read	O
the	O
news	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
world,	O
to	O
chat	O
with	O
people	O
through	O
the	O
Internet,	O
or	O
to	O
travel	O
around	O
the	O
world	O
by	O
planes;	O
however,	O
it	Arg_B
also	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
thing	Arg_I
happens	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
affect	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
we	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
react	Arg_I
properly	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
immediately,	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
vulnerable	Arg_I
situation	Arg_I
.	O
We	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
choice	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
live	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
fast	Arg_I
pace	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
while	O
there	O
some	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
live	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
pretty	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
condition,	Arg_I

In	O
my	O
opinion	O
high	Arg_B
school	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
permit	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
choose	Arg_I
courses	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
reasons	Arg_I

to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
progress	Arg_I

students	Arg_I
grades	Arg_I

knowledge	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
explore	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
aptitude	Arg_I
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
as	O
I	O
mentioned	O
above	O
students	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
choose	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
.	O
Not	Arg_B
allowing	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
desired	Arg_I
subjects	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
chosen	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
restriction	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
human	Arg_I
rights	Arg_I
.	O
As	Arg_B
children	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
independent	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
rights	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
opportunities	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
order	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
achieve	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
goals	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
dreams	Arg_I
.	O
Next,	O
students	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
choose	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
progress	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
studies	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
grades	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
we	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
avoid	Arg_I
conflicts	Arg_I
among	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
enjoyable	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
productive	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
both	Arg_I
instructor	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
when	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
taking	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
everyone	Arg_I
shared	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

it	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
other	Arg_I

Giving	Arg_B
chance	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
choose	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
interested	Arg_I
fields	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
merit	Arg_I
.	O
Lastly,	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
reason	O
I	O
support	O
this	O
idea	O
is	O
he	Arg_B

explore	Arg_I

an	Arg_I

she/he	Arg_I

When	Arg_B

can	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
kind	Arg_I

opportunity	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I

of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
point	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O
this	Arg_B

In	O
conclusion,	O
as	O
a	O

these	Arg_B

the	Arg_B
football	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
cup	Arg_I
taking	Arg_I

every	Arg_I
four	Arg_I

everyone	Arg_I

these	Arg_B

if	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

"calm	O

once	Arg_I

Without	Arg_B

he	Arg_I
directly	Arg_I
went	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

told	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

something	Arg_I

Afterward,	Arg_B
my	Arg_I

face-to	Arg_I

If	Arg_B
he	Arg_I
just	Arg_I

something	Arg_I

on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
we	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
commence	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
agree	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
communicating	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
someone	Arg_I

is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
way	Arg_I

Apart	O

the	O
one	O

mentioned	O
above,	O
another	O
equally	O
crucible	O

is	O
that	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
deceived	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
face-to	Arg_I
face	Arg_I
communication	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	Arg_B
had	Arg_I
received	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
harmful	Arg_I
words	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
facebook	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
friend,	Arg_I
Eric	Arg_I
.	O
He	Arg_B
said	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
totally	Arg_I
failed	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
building	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
friendship	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
did	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
anymore	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
just	Arg_I
shocked	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
did	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
happened	Arg_I
.	O
Finally,	O
I	Arg_B
realized	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
facebook	Arg_I
account	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
stolen	Arg_I
.	O
Hence,	O
from	O
this	O
case,	O
we	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
capable	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
stating	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
it	Arg_I

the	O

that	O
communication	Arg_B

telephone	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
enable	Arg_I
them	Arg_I

scruple,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I

parts	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

However,	O
from	O
my	O

just	O

the	O

conceivable	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
before	Arg_I

it	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

Based	O
on	O
the	O

I	Arg_B
prefer	Arg_I

The	O
first	O
and	O
foremost	O
reason	O

in	O
an	O

fact	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
more	Arg_I

we	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

chances	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
our	Arg_I

For	O

library	Arg_B

a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
place	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
study	Arg_I

They	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
concentrate	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
subjects	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
tranquil	Arg_I
ambience;	Arg_I
also,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I

utilize	Arg_I

With	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
convenient	Arg_I

versatile	Arg_I
facility,	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
condition	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
we	O
can	O
commence	O
to	O
agree	O
that	O
certain	Arg_B
facilities	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
beneficial	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
students	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
another	O
equally	O
crucial	O
aspect	O
is	O
that	O
students	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
staying	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
classrooms	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
numerous	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
school	Arg_I

Consider	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
circumstance	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
student	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
member	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
jazz	Arg_I
ensemble	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
school	Arg_I

He	Arg_B
must	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
auditorium	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
extraordinary	Arg_I
performance	Arg_I
.	O
With	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
distinguished	Arg_I
performance,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
student	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
acquire	Arg_I
an	Arg_I

Hence,	O
from	O
this	O

we	O

In	O

it	Arg_B

To	O
begin	O
with,	O
students	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
fields	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
they	Arg_I

They	Arg_B

a	Arg_B

make	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
success	Arg_I

Science	Arg_B
today,	Arg_I

important	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
for	O

that	O

the	O

them	O
to	O
abandon	O
their	O
lifelong	O

as	O
a	O
result,	O
they	Arg_B
cannot	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
enough	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
effort	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
favorite	Arg_I
games	Arg_I
as	Arg_I

15	Arg_I

For	O

the	Arg_I
majority	Arg_I
of	Arg_I

stop	Arg_I
playing	Arg_I

seriously	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
soon	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
decent	Arg_I
job	Arg_I

They	Arg_B
often	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
games	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
troublesome	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
enjoyable	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
daily	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I
.	O
Another	O
reason	O
should	O
be	O
mentioned	O

that	O
adults	Arg_B
often	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
pursue	Arg_I
games	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
competitive	Arg_I
activity,	Arg_I

on	Arg_I
competition	Arg_I

For	Arg_B
youngsters,	Arg_I
maintaining	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
desire	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
win	Arg_I

many	Arg_I
outstanding	Arg_I
characteristics	Arg_I
whether	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
participate	Arg_I

For	O

my	Arg_B

her	Arg_I
desire	Arg_I

On	O
the	O
other	O

drop	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
immediately	Arg_I

In	O
fact,	O
a	Arg_B
competitive	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
usually	Arg_I
finds	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
difficult	Arg_I
to	Arg_I

In	O

we	Arg_B

a	Arg_I

Most	Arg_B

also	Arg_I
other	Arg_I

in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

a	Arg_B

very	Arg_I
small	Arg_I
review	Arg_I

reading	Arg_B

just	Arg_I
one	Arg_I

Yet	Arg_B
these	Arg_I

read	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

wherever	Arg_I

To	O

In	O

I	O
believe	O
using	Arg_B
single	Arg_I

through	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

helping	Arg_I

A	Arg_B
world	Arg_I
with	Arg_I

helps	Arg_I

So,	O
communicating	Arg_B

reduce	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O
students	Arg_B

otherwise	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
possible	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
world	Arg_I

Single	Arg_B

Adding	O

addition,	O
if	Arg_B

my	O
opinion,	O
smoking	Arg_B

permitted,	Arg_I
especially	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
places	Arg_I

it	Arg_B

First	O
of	O
all,	O
restaurants	Arg_B

Smoking	Arg_B

Children	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
potential	Arg_I

imitate	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
adults	Arg_I

they	Arg_B

really	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
curiosity	Arg_I
towards	Arg_I
something	Arg_I

Smoking	Arg_B

they	Arg_B

breathe	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
contaminated	Arg_I

Last	O

When	Arg_B
they	Arg_I

Stroke,	Arg_B

attack	Arg_I
passive	Arg_I

Personally	O
speaking,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
unfair	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
passive	Arg_I
smokers	Arg_I

they	Arg_B
do	Arg_I

From	O
my	O
point	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
violence	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I
effects	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
youngsters	Arg_I
mostly	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
behaviors,	Arg_I
emotions	Arg_I
&	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
the	O
first	O
place,	O
children	Arg_B
behaviors	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
concerning	Arg_I
matter	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
trying	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
.	O
Nowadays	Arg_B
children	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
involved	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
TV	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
.	O
Imagine	Arg_B
an	Arg_I
actor	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
child’s	Arg_I
favorite	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
violent	Arg_I
roles	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
case,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
child	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
imitate	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
actor's	Arg_I
behaviors	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
order	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
look	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
unexpectedly	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
violent	Arg_I
behavior	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
effected	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
child’s	Arg_I
behaviors	Arg_I
.	O
Meanwhile,	O
human	Arg_B
beings	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
sensitive,	Arg_I
especially	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
youngsters	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
dying	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
disappointing	Arg_I
happening	Arg_I
.	O
Furthermore,	O
killing	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
worse	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
if	Arg_B
these	Arg_I
scenes	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
TV,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
probably	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I
effects	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
viewer	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
child	Arg_I
.	O
Finally,	O
beside	O
all	O
above	O
mentioned	O
items,	O
the	Arg_B
study	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
youngsters	Arg_I
shall	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
controlled	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
a	Arg_B
child	Arg_I
watches	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
frightening	Arg_I
movie	Arg_I
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
he	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
this	O
condition,	O
because	O
he	O
is	O
thinking	O
about	O
the	O
movie	O
or	O
whatever	O
has	O
happened	O
in	O
it,	O
it	Arg_B

that	Arg_I

study	Arg_I
perfectly	Arg_I

Hence,	O
the	Arg_B
study	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
youngster	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
affected	Arg_I
terribly	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
certainly	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
growing	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
violence	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

have	Arg_I
definitely	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I

youngsters	Arg_I

on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
study,	Arg_I

Some	Arg_B

As	Arg_B
a	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
question	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
preservation	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
old	Arg_I

has	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
pressing	Arg_I

Because	O

that	O

construct	Arg_I

preserving	Arg_I
old	Arg_I
buildings	Arg_I
.	O
Besides	O
that,	O
the	Arg_B
preservation	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
expensive	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
components	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
old	Arg_I
buildings	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
historical	Arg_I
values	Arg_I
.	O
Old	Arg_B
buildings	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
history	Arg_I
.	O
Tourist	Arg_B
often	Arg_I
decide	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
discover	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
visit	Arg_I
through	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
old	Arg_I
buildings	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
managers	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
cities	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
earn	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
attraction	Arg_I
provided	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
old	Arg_I
buildings	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I

spent	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
conservation	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O
the	Arg_B
preservation	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
old	Arg_I

is	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
ways	Arg_I

our	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I

everyone	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
them	Arg_I

Old	Arg_B
buildings	Arg_I

be	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I

Many	Arg_B

Overall,	O
both	O

So	O
I	O

we	Arg_B

for	O

Besides	O
the	O
methods,	O
from	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
providing	Arg_B
professional	Arg_I
training	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
effective	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
encouraging	Arg_I
further	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
.	O
My	O
arguments	O
for	O
this	O
point	O
are	O
listed	O
follows	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
training	Arg_B
time	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
provide	Arg_I
employee	Arg_I
interesting	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
outside	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
office	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
refresh	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
mind	Arg_I
.	O
Clearly,	O
in	Arg_B
company	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
deal	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
stressful	Arg_I
situations	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
negotiating	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
difficult	Arg_I
customer,	Arg_I
complaining	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
boss,	Arg_I
etc	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
we	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
unleash	Arg_I
uncomfortable	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
training	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
making	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
friends,	Arg_I
joking	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
class,	Arg_I
enjoying	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
employees	Arg_B
fell	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
trained	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
this	O
case,	O
the	Arg_B
employees	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
investing	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
development	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
.	O
So	O
obviously,	O
they	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
develop	Arg_I
long	Arg_I
term	Arg_I
career	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
another	O
thing,	O
employees	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
proud	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
provided	Arg_I
training	Arg_I
while	Arg_I
others	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
opportunity	Arg_I
.	O
Thirdly,	O
providing	Arg_B
training	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
employees	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
current	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
because	O
it	Arg_B
help	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
professional	Arg_I
business	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
.	O
Having	O
professional	O
training	O
help	O
employees	O
gain	O
more	O
confidence	O
in	O
their	O
business,	O
so	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
they	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
finish	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
jobs	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
excellent	Arg_I
result	Arg_I
.	O
Of	O
course,	O
excellent	Arg_B
working	Arg_I
result	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
boss	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
providing	Arg_B
professional	Arg_I
training	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
reward	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
advantages	Arg_I
.	O
Training	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
employees	Arg_I
refresh	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
mind	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
happy,	Arg_I
focus	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
.	O
Taking	O
into	O
account	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
factors,	O
we	O
may	O
reach	O
the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
training	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
effective	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
encouraging	Arg_I
further	Arg_I
good	Arg_I

Attending	O

Attending	O

one	O
of	O
activities	O
that	O
students	O
have	O
to	O
do	O

However,	O

other	O
people	O

I	O
think	O
going	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
optional	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
for	O
the	O
following	O
reasons	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
university	O
students	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
attend	O
class	O
is	O
sometimes	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
sources	Arg_I
outside	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
room	Arg_I
.	O
Student	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
library	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
focus	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
topic	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
I	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
close	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
department	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
.	O
She	Arg_B
learned	Arg_I
quickly	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
understood	Arg_I
everything	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
fast	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
she	Arg_B
rarely	Arg_I
went	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
spent	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
confusing	Arg_I
topic	Arg_I
.	O
Finally,	O
she	Arg_B
got	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
grade	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
she	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
graduation	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
students	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
attend	O
classes	O
because	O
they	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
manage	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
spending	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
benefit	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
already	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
topic	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
my	O
experience,	O
many	Arg_B
times	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
did	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
biology	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
does	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
require	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
I	Arg_B
had	Arg_I
already	Arg_I
studied	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
biology	Arg_I
topics	Arg_I
before	Arg_I
attending	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
I	Arg_B
spent	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
biology	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
Chemistry	Arg_I
research	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
got	Arg_I
A+	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
both	Arg_I
biology	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
chemistry	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
think	O
the	Arg_B
students	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
management	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
the	O
effects	O
from	O
not	O
attending	O
classes	O
.	O
So	O
that,	O
attending	Arg_B
classes	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
be	Arg_I

Through	Arg_B

It	O

powerful	Arg_I

Here	O
are	O
my	O
reasons	O

First,	O
most	Arg_B
serious	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
wide	Arg_I
variety	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
content	Arg_I

Entertaining	Arg_B
movies	Arg_I

However,	O
most	Arg_B
entertaining	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
empty	Arg_I

nonsensical	Arg_I

Compared	Arg_B
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
entertainment	Arg_I
film,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
serious	Arg_I
film	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
worthwhile	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
meaningful	Arg_I
.	O
Serious	O
movies	O
usually	O
designed	O
to	O
express	O
one	O
or	O
more	O
thinking	O
about	O
love,	O
humaneness;	O
moreover,	O
it	Arg_B
may	Arg_I
point	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
dark	Arg_I
sides	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
society	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
not	O
all	O
of	O
serious	O
movies	O
are	O
boring	O
.	O
"Click"	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
interesting	Arg_I
comedy,	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
serious	Arg_I
approach	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
importance	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
having	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
balanced	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
between	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
businesses	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
movie	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
humorous	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
satiric,which	Arg_I
leads	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
our	Arg_I

it	Arg_I
reminds	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
families	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
the	Arg_B
hidden	Arg_I
meanings	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
serious	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
usually	Arg_I
beyond	Arg_I
words	Arg_I

images	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
ourselves	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
some	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
serious	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
try	Arg_I

you	Arg_I

about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
dark	Arg_I

After	Arg_B

indeed,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
hidden	Arg_I
meaning	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

Studying	Arg_B

technology	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
convenient	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
biggest	Arg_I
advantage	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
your	Arg_I

are	Arg_I
available	Arg_I
24	Arg_I

In	O

you	Arg_B

You	Arg_B

good	Arg_I

very	Arg_I
difficult	Arg_I

complete	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
attending	Arg_B
an	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
requires	Arg_I
persistence	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
patience	Arg_I
.	O
Especially	O
when	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
instructor	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
guide	Arg_I
you,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I

up	Arg_I

you	Arg_I
to	Arg_I

Second,	O
studying	Arg_B

very	Arg_I
different	Arg_I

traditional	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I

Unlike	Arg_B
traditional	Arg_I

Students	Arg_B
may	Arg_I
find	Arg_I

without	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
kept	Arg_I
under	Arg_I
supervision	Arg_I

If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
type	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
distance-learning	Arg_I

not	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
you	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O
there	Arg_B

however,	O
our	Arg_B

with	Arg_I
classmates	Arg_I
from	Arg_I

Studying	Arg_B

As	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
concerned,	O
a	Arg_B
large	Arg_I
shopping	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O
it	Arg_B

Lastly,	O
it	Arg_B

if	Arg_B

In	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
frenetic,	Arg_I
fast-paced	Arg_I
world,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
common	Arg_I
predicament	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
us,	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
young	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
stress	Arg_B

recently	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
significant	Arg_I
issue	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
our	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O
stress	Arg_B
takes	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
toll	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
our	Arg_I

It	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
modern	Arg_I

This	Arg_B

one	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
reasons	Arg_I
why	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
were	Arg_I
overwhelmed	Arg_I

constant	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I

Thus,	O
some	Arg_B

Consequently,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I

There	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
advantages	Arg_I
setting	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

This	Arg_B

For	O

suppose	Arg_B
you	Arg_I

If	Arg_B

a	Arg_B

building	Arg_B

A	Arg_B

When	Arg_B
many	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
congregate	Arg_I

I	Arg_I
think	Arg_I

some	Arg_I

First	O
of	O
all,	O
since	O
people	O
watch	O

too	O

they	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
isolated	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
others	Arg_I

Children,	Arg_B
for	Arg_I

pay	Arg_I

show	Arg_I
provided	Arg_I

Gradually,	Arg_B
their	Arg_I

with	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

As	O
a	O
consequence,	O
children	Arg_B

learn	Arg_I
behavior	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
see	Arg_I
on	Arg_I

not	O

watching	Arg_B

For	O

Everybody	Arg_B

Second,	O
watching	Arg_B
a	Arg_I

an	Arg_I
exceptional	Arg_I

You	Arg_B

these	O

fossil	Arg_I

such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
due	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
limitation	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
technology	Arg_I
renewable	Arg_I
resources	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
relatively	Arg_I
expensive	Arg_I
.	O
Researches	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
renewable	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
cost	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
huge	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
developing	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
afford	Arg_I
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
fossil	Arg_B
fuels	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
abundant	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
inexpensive	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
areas	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
estimated	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
China	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
largest	Arg_I
deposit	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
coal	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
does	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
invest	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
forms	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
energy,	Arg_I
say	Arg_I
expensive	Arg_I
solar	Arg_I
batteries	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
wind	Arg_I
farms	Arg_I
.	O
Thus	O
the	Arg_B
plan	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
renewable	Arg_I
resources	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
face	Arg_I
challenges	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
afford	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
reforming	Arg_I
.	O
Besides,	O
although	O
utility	O
companies	O
claim	O
that	O
renewable	O
energy	O
is	O
environmentally	O
friendly;	O
these	Arg_B
new	Arg_I
forms	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
clean	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
green	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
.	O
Latest	Arg_B
studies	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
shown	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
renewable	Arg_I
resources	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
problematic	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
likely	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
pose	Arg_I
long-term	Arg_I
environmental	Arg_I
hazards	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
the	Arg_B
dams	Arg_I
built	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
hydroelectricity	Arg_I
influence	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
water	Arg_I
flows	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
rivers	Arg_I

areas	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
front	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
dams	Arg_I

This	Arg_B
damages	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
habitats	Arg_I

many	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
fish	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
wading	Arg_I
birds	Arg_I

More	O
importantly,	O
the	Arg_B
accumulation	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
bottom	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
rivers	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

extremely	Arg_I

clean	Arg_I
up;	Arg_I
leaving	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I

Thus	O

First,	O
land	Arg_B

the	O

they	Arg_B

What	O
is	O
more,	O
the	Arg_B
society	Arg_I

It	O

Last	O

most	Arg_I

it	Arg_I

cause	Arg_I

extra	Arg_I
burden	Arg_I

them	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O
jobs	Arg_B

extra	Arg_I
work	Arg_I

In	O

to	O
this,	O
the	Arg_B
main	Arg_I
drawback	Arg_I

that,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
miss	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

out	Arg_I

social	Arg_I
interaction	Arg_I

whole	Arg_I
life	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
childhood	Arg_I

When	Arg_B
we	Arg_I
captivate	Arg_I

put	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

The	Arg_B

On	O
the	O

have	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I
impact	Arg_I

Apparently,	O
more	Arg_B

busier	Arg_I

that	Arg_I

However,	O
the	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

In	O

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O

the	Arg_B
drawbacks	Arg_I

it	O

Improve	O
roads	O

Many	O

think	O
that	O
governments	O
should	O
spend	O
money	O
on	O
improving	O
roads	O
and	O
highways	O
while	O
the	O
others	O
say	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
better	O
to	O
spend	O
money	O
on	O
public	O
transportation	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
governments	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
certainly	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
system	Arg_I
because	O
it	Arg_B
would	Arg_I
deal	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
rising	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
private	Arg_I
cars	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
creating	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
the	Arg_B
using	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
reduces	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
resources	Arg_I
using	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
.	O
Cars	Arg_B
depend	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
gasoline,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
non-renewable	Arg_I
resource	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
the	Arg_B
more	Arg_I
cars	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
faster	Arg_I
gasoline	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
the	O
contrary,	O
if	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
efficiently	Arg_I
used,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
gasoline	Arg_I
consuming	Arg_I
per	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
lower	Arg_I
.	O
And	O
this	Arg_B
definitely	Arg_I
helps	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
reserve	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
invaluable	Arg_I
natural	Arg_I
resource,	Arg_I
gasoline	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
public	Arg_B
transportation	Arg_I
helps	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
solve	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
air	Arg_I
pollution	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
.	O
Averagely,	O
public	Arg_B
transports	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
gasoline	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
carry	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
private	Arg_I
cars	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
means	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
using	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transports,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
gas	Arg_I
exhaust	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
pumped	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
air	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
longer	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
bear	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
stuffy	Arg_I
situation	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
roads,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
full	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
fumes	Arg_I
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
using	Arg_B
public	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
safer	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
private	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
.	O
According	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
National	Arg_I
Safety	Arg_I
Council,	Arg_I
riding	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
bus	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
over	Arg_I
170	Arg_I
times	Arg_I
safer	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
private	Arg_I
care	Arg_I
.	O
Thus	O
there	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
reason	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
governments	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
hesitate	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
invest	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transportation,	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
healthy,	Arg_I
safe	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
economical	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
transporting	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
short,	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
for	O
certain	O
that	O
spending	Arg_B
money	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
improving	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
necessary	Arg_I
because	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
key	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
protect	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
world,	Arg_I
creating	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
healthy	Arg_I

I	Arg_B

Therefore	O
I	O
strongly	O

the	O

that	Arg_I

First,	O
if	Arg_B
you	Arg_I

only	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
luck	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
your	Arg_I

you	Arg_I

Luck	Arg_B

something	Arg_I

no	Arg_I

guarantee	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
ever	Arg_I
come	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
it	Arg_I
doesn't	Arg_I
work,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
disappointment	Arg_I

Instead	O
if	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
strive	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
achieve	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
want,	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
you	Arg_I

your	Arg_I
final	Arg_I
goal	Arg_I

In	O
my	O
personal	O
experience,	O
all	Arg_B
my	Arg_I

were	Arg_I
backed	Arg_I

my	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
work,	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
luck	Arg_I

And	O
I	Arg_B

encounter	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
disappointments	Arg_I

my	Arg_I
goals	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
if	O
you	O
believe	O
that	O
hard	O
work	O
is	O
the	O
key	O

success,	O
it	O
would	O
make	O
you	O

In	O
other	O
words,	O
those	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
believe	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
clear	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
goals	Arg_I

know	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
final	Arg_I

They	Arg_B
carefully	Arg_I
organize	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
process	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
achieving	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
targets	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
continue	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
evaluate	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
progress	Arg_I
until	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
reach	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
final	Arg_I
goal	Arg_I

If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
believe	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
luck,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
clueless	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
where	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
heading	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
a	Arg_B
friend	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
mine,	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
severe	Arg_I
financial	Arg_I
constraints,	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
habit	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
buying	Arg_I
lottery	Arg_I
tickets	Arg_I
thinking	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
win	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lottery	Arg_I
.	O
He	Arg_B
was	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
illusion	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
solve	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
financial	Arg_I
issues	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
lottery	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
up	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
luck	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
appeared	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
got	Arg_I
further	Arg_I
worsened	Arg_I
.	O
Thirdly,	O
if	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
hard,	Arg_I
luck	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
might	Arg_I
shine	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
steps	Arg_I
further	Arg_I
ahead	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
actual	Arg_I
target	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
my	Arg_B
boss	Arg_I
worked	Arg_I
tirelessly	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
promotion	Arg_I
.	O
He	Arg_B
looked	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
aspect	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
needed	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
qualify	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
promotion	Arg_I
.	O
He	Arg_B
realized	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
having	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
master's	Arg_I
degree	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
credential	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
outperform	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
competitors	Arg_I
.	O
Although	O
he	Arg_B
had	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
commitments	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
work,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
somehow	Arg_I
managed	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
complete	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
degree	Arg_I
before	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
eligible	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
apply	Arg_I
.	O
At	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
end	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
promotion	Arg_I
amidst	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
stiff	Arg_I
competition	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
got	Arg_I
nominated	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
scholarship	Arg_I
since	O
he	Arg_B
had	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
credentials	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
officers	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
capacity	Arg_I
.	O
Although	O
it	O
is	O
good	O
to	O
be	O
lucky,	O
depending	Arg_B
on	Arg_I
luck	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
everything	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
.	O
Hence	O
I	Arg_B
strongly	Arg_I
believe	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
easily	Arg_I
disappoint	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
luck	Arg_I
sometimes	Arg_I
does	Arg_I
.	O

Should	O

The	O

whether	O
it	O

obligatory	O
for	O

This	O

an	O

there	O
are	O
various	O

this	O

An	O

whether	O

or	O
the	O

for	O
the	O

However,	O
to	O
my	O
mind	O
students	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
free	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
because	O
it	Arg_B
improves	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
student	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
motivation	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
teaches	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
.	O
Firstly,	O
a	O
liberal	O
policy	O
is	O
very	O
feasible	O
.	O
Checking	O
for	O
attendance	O
requires	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
bureaucracy	O
.	O
Especially	O
for	O
larger	O
classes	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
check	O
for	O
everybody	O
to	O
attend	O
.	O
So	O
an	O
optional	O
attendance	O
saves	O
time	O
and	O
money	O
.	O
Secondly,	O
some	Arg_B
students	Arg_I
might	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own,	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
instance,	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
reading	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
textbook	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
problem	Arg_I
occurs	Arg_I
especially	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
lecturer	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
lethargic	Arg_I
.	O
By	Arg_B
letting	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
choose	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
opportunity	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
escape	Arg_I
bad	Arg_I
teaching	Arg_I
.	O
Thus	O
they	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
save	Arg_I
precious	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
dive	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
syllabus	Arg_I
independently	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
being	Arg_B
free	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
stay	Arg_I
away	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
improves	Arg_I
flexibility	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
therefore	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
student	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
Sometimes	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
wild	Arg_I
party	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
Thursday	Arg_I
night	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
end	Arg_I
already	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
midnight	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lecture	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
Friday	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
morning	Arg_I
.	O
With	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
liberal	Arg_I
policy	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
postpone	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
afternoon	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
gives	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
feeling	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
freedom	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
improves	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
efficiency	Arg_I
.	O
Research	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
shown	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
satisfied	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
those	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
perform	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I

Finally,	O

Intrinsic	Arg_B
motivation	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
known	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
much	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
the	Arg_B
first	Arg_I
advantage	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
small	Arg_I
town	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

less	Arg_I
population	Arg_I
that	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

Also,	O
in	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
small	Arg_I
town	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
crowded	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
less	Arg_I

Living	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

such	Arg_I

life	Arg_I

one	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
main	Arg_I
consequences	Arg_I

less	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I

more	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
in	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
small	Arg_I
town	Arg_I
foods	Arg_I

materials	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
need	Arg_I

healthier	Arg_I

Regardless	O
of	O
some	O

it	Arg_B

that	Arg_I
living	Arg_I

towns	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
healthier	Arg_I

in	Arg_I
big	Arg_I
cities	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
another	Arg_B
advantage	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
small	Arg_I

Living	Arg_B

living	Arg_I
cost	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
fewer	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
big	Arg_I
cities	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
town	O
we	O
can	O
live	O
in	O
big	O
houses	O

good	O

also	O
because	Arg_B

Transportation	Arg_B
cost	Arg_I

that	O

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	Arg_B

I	O
think	O
it	Arg_B

some	Arg_I

Obviously,	O
many	Arg_B

Therefore	O
they	Arg_B

For	O

if	Arg_B

instead	Arg_I

returning	Arg_I
his	Arg_I

I	O
completely	O

the	O
idea	O
that	O
governments	Arg_B

greater	Arg_I
portion	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
budgets	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
precautions	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
first	O
reason	O
why	O
education	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
preventative	Arg_I
measures	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
receive	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
greater	Arg_I
budget	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
potential	Arg_I
improvements	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
system	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
decreasing	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
patients	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
system	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
lead	Arg_I
hospitals	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
healthcare	Arg_I
centers	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
managed	Arg_I
effectively	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
result	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
treatments	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
current	Arg_I
patients	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
society	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
educated	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
became	Arg_I
aware	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
issues	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
potential	Arg_I
precautions	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
illnesses	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
taken	Arg_I
instead	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
trying	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
provide	Arg_I
treatment	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
increasing	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
patients	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
second	O
reason	O
why	O
governments	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
allocate	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
budget	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
prevention	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
illness	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
providing	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
welfare	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
society	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
there	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
nothing	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
human's	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
happiness	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
welfare	Arg_I
come	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
a	Arg_B
government's	Arg_I
role	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
providing	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
lead	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
citizens	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prevent	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
potential	Arg_I
illness	Arg_I
that	Arg_I

cause	Arg_I
misery	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
people's	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I

For	O

the	Arg_B
marketing	Arg_I
campaign	Arg_I

adapted	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
lifestyle	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
campaign	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
a	Arg_B
greater	Arg_I
proportion	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

The	Arg_B

Let's	Arg_B

all,	O
although	O
it	Arg_B

that	Arg_I

everywhere	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
society,	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
restaurant	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
ignorance	Arg_I

It	O

the	Arg_B
second-hand	Arg_I
smoke,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I

from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

one	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
smoking	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

their	Arg_I
health	Arg_I

This	O

because	O
some	Arg_B

smoking	Arg_B

At	O

the	Arg_B

smoking	Arg_B

at	Arg_B

we	Arg_B

one	Arg_I
personal	Arg_I

not	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
show	Arg_I

Playing	Arg_B

play	Arg_I
classical	Arg_I

When	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
meet	Arg_I

the	O
most	O
important	O
The	O

a	O
long	O
time	O

From	O
my	O
perspective,	O
the	Arg_B
most	Arg_I
possible	Arg_I
solution	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
improving	Arg_I
roads	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
highways	Arg_I
because	O
of	O
three	O
crucial	O
reasons	O
.	O
First	O
and	O
foremost,	O
we	Arg_B
all	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
upgrading	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
surely	Arg_I
aggravate	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
pollution	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
accidents	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
buses,	Arg_I
cars	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
trains	Arg_I
regularly	Arg_I
emit	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
noxious	Arg_I
gas	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
causes	Arg_I
lots	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
fatal	Arg_I
diseases	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
lung	Arg_I
cancer	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
pneumonia	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
the	Arg_B
sound	Arg_I
emanates	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
engines	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
worsen	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
hearing	Arg_I
.	O
Most	O
importantly,	O
there	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
accidents	Arg_I
happening	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
roads	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	Arg_B
my	Arg_I
country,	Arg_I
buses	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
attributed	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
cause	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
skyrocketing	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
accidents	Arg_I
.	O
Each	O
year,	O
Vietnam	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
approximately	Arg_I
twelve	Arg_I
thousand	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
die	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
accidents	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
equivalent	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
death	Arg_I
toll	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
tsunami	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
Japan	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
investing	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
roads	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
highways	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
broaden	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
area	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
allow	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
.	O
Not	Arg_B
only	Arg_I
buses	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
personal	Arg_I
vehicles	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
move	Arg_I
easily	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
roads	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	Arg_B
always	Arg_I
leave	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
everybody	Arg_I
rushes	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
roads	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
hastily	Arg_I
goes	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
extremely	Arg_I
troublesome	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
escape	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
crowd	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
roads	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
hour	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
contrast,	O
if	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
roads	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
enlarged,	Arg_I
everyone	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
short	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
hardly	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
collisions	Arg_I
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
spending	Arg_B
on	Arg_I
renovating	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
highways	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
roads	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I
.	O
All	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
afraid	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
moving	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
rough	Arg_I
roads	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
lots	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
portholes	Arg_I
.	O
Those	Arg_B
bad	Arg_I
conditions	Arg_I
result	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
terrible	Arg_I
accidents	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
worried	Arg_I
.	O
We	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
accuse	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
drivers	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
causing	Arg_I
accidents	Arg_I
because	O
a	Arg_B
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
responsibility	Arg_I
belongs	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
authorities	Arg_I
.	O
What's	Arg_B
more,	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
smooth	Arg_I
surface	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I

become	Arg_I
safer	Arg_I

easier	Arg_I

In	O
a	O

the	Arg_B
advantages	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
roads	Arg_I

there	O
may	O

some	O

perspectives	O
that	O
I	O
neglected	O

fully	O
consider	O

Nevertheless,	O
for	O
the	O
reasons	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
presented	O
above,	O
I	Arg_B
would	Arg_I
assert	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
change	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
improved	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
significantly	Arg_I
.	O

Are	O
parents	O
best	O
teachers?	O
It	O
is	O
obvious	O
that	O
parents	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
first	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
teach	Arg_I
babies	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
walk	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
speak	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
parents	Arg_B
provide	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
social	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
order	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children's	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
children	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
taught	Arg_I
basic	Arg_I
things,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
influence	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
whole	Arg_I
life,	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
.	O
As	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
baby,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
thing	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
around	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
everything	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
.	O
Parents	Arg_B
always	Arg_I
try	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
explain	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
describe	Arg_I
tenderly	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
simple	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
baby	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
.	O
Consequently,	O
parents	Arg_B
bring	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
whole	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
wonderful	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
colorful	Arg_I
thing	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
baby's	Arg_I
little	Arg_I
mind	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
parents	Arg_B
train	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
child	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
always	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
basically	Arg_I
say	Arg_I
thanks	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
apology	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
.	O
On	O
the	O
one	O
hand,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
common	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
try	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
explain	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
bad	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
children	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
shown	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
behave	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
others	Arg_I
.	O
This	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
easy	O
but	O
this	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
influence	Arg_I
positively	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
children's	Arg_I
behavior	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
before	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
face	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
real	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
.	O
Third,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
parents	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
ones	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
loves	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
care	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
they	Arg_B
tend	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
provide	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
advice	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
experience	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
.	O
Unlike	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
professional,	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
support	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
social	Arg_I
skill	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
communicate	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
others	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
habit	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
parents'	Arg_B
support	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
factor	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
succeed	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
parents	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
really	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
advice	Arg_I
.	O
Based	O
on	O
love,	O
they	O
always	O
try	O
their	O
best	O
to	O
make	O
good	O
condition	O
for	O
their	O
children	O

Tv	O

NO	O

Nowadays,	O
we	O
have	O
undergone	O
many	O
technology	O
innovations	O
such	O
as	O
Tv	O

Many	O
people	O
say	O
that	O

on	O
children,	O
since	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
violent	O
or	O
inappropriate	O
for	O
children	O
.	O
However,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
television	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
positive	Arg_I
effects	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I
effects	Arg_I
.	O
There	O
are	O
two	O
reasons	O
to	O
support	O
my	O
idea	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
television	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
useful	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
educational	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
.	O
Not	Arg_B
only	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
up-to-date	Arg_I
news,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
educational	Arg_I
purposes	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
children	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
wisely,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
information	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	Arg_B
Korea,	Arg_I
there's	Arg_I
program	Arg_I
called	Arg_I
EBS	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
targeted	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
teenager	Arg_I
.	O
We	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
subjects	Arg_I
through	Arg_I
EBS	Arg_I
lecture	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
there	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
documentary	Arg_I
films	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
man	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
Korea	Arg_I
.	O
Using	Arg_B
those	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
let	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
inspirations	Arg_I
instead	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
having	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I
effects	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
Tv	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
helpful	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
relieve	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
stresses	Arg_I
.	O
There	O
are	O
many	O
Tv	O
programs	O
such	O
as	O
sports	O
programs	O
.	O
Many	O
children	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
stresses	O
recently,	O
since	O
they	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
pressure	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
.	O
When	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
watching	Arg_I
sports	Arg_I
programs,	Arg_I
it's	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
relieve	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
stresses	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
an	O
example,	O
I	Arg_B
got	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
.	O
So,	O
I	O
was	O
quite	O
aggressive,	O
however	O
.	O
After	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
watch	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
soccer	Arg_I
match	Arg_I
between	Arg_I
Korea	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
Japan,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
gone	Arg_I
.	O
Instead,	O
this	O
soccer	O
match	O
helped	O
me	O
to	O
continue	O
my	O
academic	O
career	O
in	O
the	O
school,	O
since	O
it	Arg_B
helped	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
relieve	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
of	O
course,	O
the	O
television	O
can	O
have	O
violent	O
programs,	O
however,	O
if	Arg_B
children	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
Tv	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
wisely,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
positive	Arg_I
effects	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I
effects	Arg_I
.	O
Now	O
that,	O
it	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
useful	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
educational	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
quite	Arg_I
helpful	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
relieve	Arg_I
stresses	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
these	O
reasons,	O
I	Arg_B
strongly	Arg_I
disagree	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
statement	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
television	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I
effects	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
children	Arg_I

From	O

those	O

not	O
only	O
conservative	O
but	O
also	O
out-of-date	O

I	O
am	O
biased	O
towards	O
the	O
opposite	O
side	O
that	O
businesses	Arg_B
had	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
employ	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
workers	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
whole	Arg_I
of	Arg_I

because	O
of	O
the	O
three	O

First	O
and	O
foremost,	O
various	Arg_B
ideas	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
creativity	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
indispensable	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
flourish	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
invaluable	Arg_I
experience	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
senior	Arg_I
employees	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
pass	Arg_I
down	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
apprentices	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
job,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
regularly	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
creative	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
novel	Arg_I
ideas	Arg_I
.	O
What's	O
more,	O
the	Arg_B
rapid	Arg_I
development	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
field	Arg_I
nowadays	Arg_I
requires	Arg_I
precise	Arg_I
updates	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
access	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
the	Arg_B
youngsters	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
capable	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
meeting	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
standards	Arg_I
.	O
More	O
importantly,	O
they	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
activeness,	Arg_I
inventiveness	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
enterprise	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
allow	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
complete	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
jobs	Arg_I
perfectly	Arg_I
.	O
These	Arg_B
vital	Arg_I
factors	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
decide	Arg_I
whether	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
thrive	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
the	Arg_B
staff	Arg_I
soon	Arg_I
gets	Arg_I
boring	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
stable	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
long	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
.	O
At	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
certain	Arg_I
time,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
presume	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
securing	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
necessary	Arg_I
because	O
they	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
earn	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
manage	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
Thereafter,	O
the	Arg_B
bulk	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
realize	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
promotion	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
competition	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
assist	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
horizons	Arg_I
also	O
.	O
Many	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
enjoy	Arg_I
challenging	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
because	O
they	Arg_B
don	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
monotonous	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
passive	Arg_I
ones	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
same-old-same-old	O
environment	O
soon	O
makes	O
them	O
depressed,	O
so	O
this	Arg_B
situation	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
adverse	Arg_I
impact	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
enterprise	Arg_I
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
the	Arg_B
economic	Arg_I
crisis	Arg_I

financial	Arg_I
recession	Arg_I
result	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
tremendous	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
unemployment	Arg_I

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
the	Arg_B
businesses	Arg_I
ought	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
recruit	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
workers	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
as	Arg_I

tackle	Arg_I
this	Arg_I

earn	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
living	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O
the	Arg_B
factories	Arg_I

will	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
abundant	Arg_I
human	Arg_I

consequences	Arg_I

serious	Arg_I

that	Arg_I

be	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
were	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I

Another	Arg_B
great	Arg_I
thing	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
child	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
possibility	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
interesting	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
live	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
single	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
.	O
Being	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
child	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
single	Arg_I
thing	Arg_I
around	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
discovered	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
you	Arg_I

There	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
lots	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
facts	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
learn,	Arg_I
stories	Arg_I
you	Arg_I

listen	Arg_I
to	Arg_I

things	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
see	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
childhood	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
period	Arg_I

time	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

Using	Arg_B
your	Arg_I
imagination	Arg_I

saying	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
freely	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
another	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
thing	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
child	Arg_I

Children	Arg_B

not	Arg_I

about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
they	Arg_I

much	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
adults,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
freedom	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
express	Arg_I
yourself	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
developing	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
colorful	Arg_I
imagination	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
adulthood,	O
people	O
are	O
forced	O

they	Arg_B

in	Arg_I
no	Arg_I

Childhood,	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
several	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

our	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I
.	O
It's	Arg_B
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
nature	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
childhood	Arg_I

also	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

our	Arg_I

Although	O
it	O

true	O
that	O
life	O

rapidly,	O
there	Arg_B

many	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

success	Arg_I

knowledge	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
fields	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
study	Arg_I

First	O
of	O
all,	O
the	Arg_B
predecessors'	Arg_I
mistakes	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
first	Arg_I
thing	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
consider	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
past	Arg_I

As	Arg_B
everyone's	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
short	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
risk	Arg_I
trying	Arg_I
anything	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
prepare,	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
other's	Arg_I
mistakes	Arg_I
so	O
that	O
we	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
avoid	Arg_I
making	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
ones	Arg_I
.	O
Each	Arg_B
mistake,	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
smallest	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
bigger	Arg_I
one,	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
treasure	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
experience,	Arg_I
which,	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
full	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
of,	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
well-prepared	Arg_I

many	Arg_I
complicated	Arg_I
situations	Arg_I

our	Arg_I
life	Arg_I

saves	Arg_I
ourselves	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
bunch	Arg_I

failures	Arg_I

times	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
people's	Arg_B
success	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
past	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
significant	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
mistakes	Arg_I
.	O
If	O
the	O

are	O
the	O
indirect	O
way	O
that	O

us	O

the	O

In	O
my	O
views,	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
teenage	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
part-time	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
when	Arg_B
children	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
job,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
earn	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
themselves,	Arg_I
instead	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
getting	Arg_I
pocket	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
oppertunity	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
deal	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
.	O
Take	O
me	O
as	O
an	O
example,	O
when	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
16,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
found	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
during	Arg_I
summer	Arg_I
vacation	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
earned	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
.	O
At	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
beginning	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
semester,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
told	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
buy	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
text	Arg_I
book	Arg_I
.	O
Unfortunately,	O
I	Arg_B
spent	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
salary	Arg_I
hanging	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
I	Arg_B
finally	Arg_I
realized	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
plan	Arg_I
before	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
money,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
did	Arg_I
influence	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
now	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
by	Arg_B
taking	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
part-time	Arg_I
job,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
certainly	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
responsible	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
anything	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
done	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
if	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
student	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
frequently	Arg_I
late	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
work,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
reduce	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
payment	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
fire	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
.	O
To	Arg_B
compare	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
life,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
might	Arg_I
suffer	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
small	Arg_I
punishment	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
.	O
Under	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
circumstances,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
obey	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
rule	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
responsibility	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
to	Arg_B
help	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
adapt	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
life,	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
let	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
experience	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
.	O
Due	O
to	O
the	O
reasons	O
given	O
above,	O
to	Arg_B
encourage	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
taking	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
part-time	Arg_I

In	Arg_B
a	Arg_I

you	Arg_I

Growing	O
up	O
in	O
the	O

not	O
such	O
a	O
good	O
experience,	O
you	Arg_B
won’t	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I

your	Arg_I

really	Arg_I
limited	Arg_I

If	O
someday	O
I	O
have	O
children,	O
I’m	O
absolutely	O
sure	O
that	O
they	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
grow	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
neighborhood	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
big	Arg_I
city	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
.	O

Parents	O
are	O
the	O
best	O
teachers	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
more	O
special	O
than	O
everybody	O
else	O
I	O
completely	O
agree	O
that	O
parents	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
.	O
Children	Arg_B
normally	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
somehow	Arg_I
special	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
children’s	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I
.	O
Firstly,	O
the	Arg_B
things	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
say	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
power	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
child	Arg_I
.	O
More	Arg_B
power	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	Arg_B
someone	Arg_I
tells	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
kid	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
something	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
wrong	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
shouldn't	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
it,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
father	Arg_I
told	Arg_I
him/her	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
right,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
kid	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
listen	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
father	Arg_I
instead	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
person,	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
father	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
wrong	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
a	O
child	O
normally	O
spends	O
more	O
time	O
with	O
their	O
parents	O
than	O
with	O
other	O
people,	O
so	O
their	Arg_B
parents	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
teach	Arg_I
him/her	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
anybody	Arg_I
else	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
contact	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
intimacy	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
.	O
Lastly,	O
children	Arg_B
usually	Arg_I
mirror	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
.	O
That’s	O
as	O
important	O
thing	O
because	O
even	Arg_B
if	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
don’t	Arg_I
intend	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
teach	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
something,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
observing	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
.	O
So,	O
if	Arg_B
there	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
man	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
beats	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
wife	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
treats	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
bad,	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
child	Arg_I
probably	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
going	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
rude	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
treat	Arg_I
girls	Arg_I
bad	Arg_I
.	O
All	O
in	O
all,	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
parents	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
greatest	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
and	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
very	O
careful	O
with	O
what	O
they	O
say	O
and	O
do	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
their	O
child,	O
because	O
it	O
can	O
define	O
who	O
he	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
.	O

Easy	O
preparation	O
of	O
food	O
leads	O
to	O
a	O
better	O
life	O
The	O
Technology	O
has	O
developed	O
a	O
lot	O
.	O
With	O
that	O
development,	O
food	O
can	O
be	O
prepared	O
more	O
easily	O
and	O
it	O
can	O
taste	O
a	O
lot	O
better	O
than	O
it	O
used	O
to	O
.	O
With	O
that	O
change,	O
people’s	O
lives	O
are	O
a	O
lot	O
better	O
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
Some	O
good	O
reasons	O
are	O
about	O
having	O
more	O
time	O
and	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
prepare	O
better	O
food	O
without	O
being	O
a	O
good	O
cook	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
people	Arg_B
normally	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
lots	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
.	O
Because	O
of	O
that,	O
they	Arg_B
don’t	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
kitchen	Arg_I
.	O
But	O
being	Arg_B
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
tasty	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
putting	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
microwave	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
oven	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
awesome	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	Arg_B
an	Arg_I
engineer	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
project,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
deliver	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
tomorrow,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
save	Arg_I
hours	Arg_I
preparing	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
microwave	Arg_I
instead	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
cooking	Arg_I
everything	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
scratch	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
when	Arg_B
someone	Arg_I
wants	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
alone	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
reason,	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
ago	Arg_I
he/she	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
cook	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
food,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
nowadays	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
healthy	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
tasty	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
guy	Arg_I
wants	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
dinner	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
girlfriend,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
buy	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
comes	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
instructions	Arg_I
.	O
Normally	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
put	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
oven	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
wait	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
.	O
All	O
in	O
all,	O
that	O
ease	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
improved	Arg_I
people’s	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I
.	O
And	O
that	O
happened	O
mainly	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
development	O
of	O
the	O
technology	O
.	O
But	O
people	O
should	O
be	O
careful	O
with	O
what	O
they	O
eat,	O
because	O
some	O
industrial	O
foods	O
are	O
very	O
bad	O
for	O
their	O
health,	O
so	O
they	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
buy	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
food	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
known	Arg_I
brands	Arg_I
.	O

Should	O
University	O
education	O
be	O
free	O
for	O
everyone	O

A	O
famous	O
proverb	O
“Knowledge	O

power”	O

demonstrated	O
the	O
value	O

education	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
universities	Arg_B

provide	Arg_I
free	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
cost	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

scholars	Arg_I

now-a-days	Arg_B
universities	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
name	Arg_I
charge	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
fees	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
leads	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
affordability	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
have	O
observed	O
that	O
many	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
interested	Arg_I
scholars	Arg_I
failed	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
admission	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
universities	Arg_I
because	O
they	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
along	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
studies,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
left	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
choice,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
.	O
University	O
is	O
more	O
likely	O

a	O

business,	O
the	Arg_B
issue	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
affordability	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
crucial	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
today’s	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
getting	Arg_I
expensive,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
tending	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
apply	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
self-finance	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
order	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
admission	Arg_I
.	O
Whereas,	O
the	Arg_B
scholars	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
facing	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
difficulties	Arg_I
apart	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
requirements	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
manage	Arg_I
two	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
for	Arg_I

working	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
scholars,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
concentrate	Arg_I

their	Arg_I

.	O
MPhils	Arg_B

PhDs	Arg_I

are	Arg_I
probably	Arg_I
engage	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
research	Arg_I
work,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
takes	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
full	Arg_I
concentration	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
surveys	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
idea	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
free	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
charge	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
inspires	Arg_I
those	Arg_I

efforts	Arg_I

get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

by	Arg_I
most	Arg_I

In	O

a	Arg_B

If	Arg_B
people	Arg_I

In	O

First,	O
for	Arg_B

Few	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
happiness	Arg_I

they	Arg_B

more	Arg_I

30	Arg_I

after	Arg_I

Second,	O

conclusion,	O
it	Arg_B

However,	O
from	O
my	O

television	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
bad	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
because	O
it	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
made	Arg_I

not	Arg_I

have	Arg_I
conversation	Arg_I
each	Arg_I

To	O
begin	O
with,	O
television	Arg_B
shows	Arg_I
make	Arg_I

them	Arg_I
when	Arg_I

Thus,	O

out	Arg_I

their	Arg_I

One	Arg_B

only	Arg_I
about	Arg_I

also	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
friendship,	Arg_I

depends	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
often	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
meet	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I

That	O
is,	O
watching	Arg_B
television	Arg_I
alone	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
home,	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
lost	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
opportunity	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
cohesion	Arg_I
between	Arg_I
us	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
even	Arg_B
when	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
watch	Arg_I
television	Arg_I
together,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
them	Arg_I

Watching	Arg_B
television	Arg_I
program	Arg_I

not	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
watching	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
program	Arg_I
alone	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
watch	Arg_I
television	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
want	Arg_I

To	O
illustrate	O
my	O
point,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
reported	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
converse	Arg_I

their	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
watching	Arg_I
television	Arg_I

.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
natural	Arg_I
they	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
way	Arg_I

television	Arg_B

any	Arg_I
participation	Arg_I

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
firmly	O
believe	O
that	O
it	Arg_B

detrimental	Arg_I

members	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

of	Arg_I
television	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
stare	Arg_I
forward	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
television	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
obsessed	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
it	Arg_I

also	Arg_I

their	Arg_I

Haste	O

This	O

stating	O
that	O
every	Arg_B
fast	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
thought	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
wasted	Arg_I
one	Arg_I

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
this	O
statement	O

completely	O
true,	O
for	O
these	O
few	O
reasons:	O
For	O
one	O
thing,	O
making	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
quick	Arg_I
decision	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
it's	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
thought	Arg_I
out,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
hasn't	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
checked	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
aspects	Arg_I

Consequently,	O
making	Arg_B
quick	Arg_I
decisions	Arg_I
leads	Arg_I

probable	Arg_I
bad	Arg_I
results	Arg_I

For	O

if	Arg_B
someone	Arg_I
decided	Arg_I

quit	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
job	Arg_I

really	Arg_I
thinking	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
alternative,	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
plan	Arg_I
B,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I

up	Arg_I

his	Arg_I
speedy	Arg_I
decision	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
making	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
rushed	Arg_I
decision	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
mean	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
missing	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
potential	Arg_I
opportunity	Arg_I

In	O
another	O
word,	O
if	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
waited	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
thought	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
decision	Arg_I
through	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
wouldn't	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
missed	Arg_I
out	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
job	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

Not	O

mention,	O
that	O
hasty	Arg_B
decisions,	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
goes	Arg_I
to	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

what	O

his	Arg_B

now	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
maintain	Arg_I
relationships	Arg_I
over	Arg_I
great	Arg_I

they	Arg_B

From	O
my	O

recall	O
that	O
my	Arg_B
car	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
see	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
childhood	Arg_I

very	Arg_I

living	Arg_I
89	Arg_I
kilometers	Arg_I
away	Arg_I

Thanks	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
car	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
see	Arg_I
each	Arg_I

at	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

Without	Arg_B
my	Arg_I

been	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
develop	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
relationship	Arg_I

In	O
addition,	O
cars	Arg_B
increase	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

more	Arg_I

He	Arg_B
used	Arg_I
his	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
end	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
week	Arg_I

came	Arg_I
home	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
weekend	Arg_I

If	Arg_B
he	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
no	Arg_I

be	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
see	Arg_I
his	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

him	Arg_I
his	Arg_I

the	Arg_B

the	Arg_B
gap	Arg_I

it	Arg_I

However,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
as	Arg_B
long	Arg_I

In	O
conclusion,	O
high	Arg_B

Therefore,	O
here	O

the	O
point	O
that	O
people	Arg_B
who	Arg_I

others'	Arg_I
criticism	Arg_I

Personally,	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
this	O
statement	O
.	O
First,	O
the	Arg_B
core	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
"consensus"	Arg_I
.	O
It's	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
idea	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
everyone’s	Arg_I
opinion	Arg_I
accounts	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
group	Arg_I
works,	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
members	Arg_I
gather	Arg_I
together	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
brain-storming	Arg_I
discussion,	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
over	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
possible	Arg_I
solutions	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
finally	Arg_I
reach	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
agreement	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
this	O
long	O
process	O
of	O
discussion,	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
different	O
opinions	O
sparkling	O
out	O
.	O
It	Arg_B
doesn't	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
member	Arg_I
solely	Arg_I
insists	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
his/her	Arg_I
idea	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
doesn't	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
member's	Arg_I
criticism	Arg_I
because	O
the	Arg_B
work	Arg_I
belongs	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
member,	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
personal	Arg_I
show	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
specific	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
member	Arg_I
.	O
It's	Arg_B
every	Arg_I
member's	Arg_I
duty	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
respect	Arg_I
other's	Arg_I
opinion	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
taking	Arg_B
criticism	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
virtue	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
someone's	Arg_I
opinion	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
against	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
.	O
Even	Arg_B
if	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
group,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
others'	Arg_I
criticism	Arg_I
.	O
Criticism	Arg_B
definitely	Arg_I
hurts	Arg_I
because	O
it	Arg_B
points	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
drawbacks	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
forces	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
confront	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
criticism	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
detect	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
drawbacks	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
fix	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
willing	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
.	O
Those	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
word	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
criticism	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
eventually	Arg_I
lose	Arg_I
chances	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
improved	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
if	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
can't	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
criticism,	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
fail	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
cooperating	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
people,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
defeated	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
personal	Arg_I
works	Arg_I
.	O
As	Arg_B
one	Arg_I
Chinese	Arg_I
idiom	Arg_I
goes:	Arg_I
"The	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
medicine	Arg_I
tastes	Arg_I
bitter“	Arg_I
.	O
Criticism	Arg_B
might	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
powerful	Arg_I
solution	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
heal	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
some	O
people	O
might	O
ask:	O
what	O
if	O
the	O
criticism	O
proves	O
to	O
be	O
wrong?	O
What	O
if	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
right	O
but	O
the	O
seemingly	O
reasonable	O
criticism	O
led	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
wrong	O
direction?	O
Doesn't	O
insistence	O
also	O
a	O
good	O
character?	O
In	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
even	Arg_B
if	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
right,	Arg_I
criticism	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
helpful	Arg_I
because	O
in	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
case	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
fixer,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
serves	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
practice	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
test	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
.	O
Taking	Arg_B
criticism	Arg_I
doesn't	Arg_I
necessary	Arg_I
mean	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
.	O
You	O
should	O
have	O
your	O
own	O
judgments	O
too!	O
And	Arg_B
it's	Arg_I
kind	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
criticism	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
criticism	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I
especially	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
occasions	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
criticism	Arg_I
.	O
It's	O
just	O
like	O
a	O
picky	O
mirror	O
through	O
which	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
the	O
bad	O

my	O

the	O
second	O
idea	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
best	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
for	Arg_I

First	O

all,	O
by	Arg_B
explaining	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
subject	Arg_I
contributes	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
daily	Arg_I
life,	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
vivid	Arg_I
impression	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
subject	Arg_I
thus	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
interested	Arg_I

active	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
acquiring	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
subject	Arg_I

Take	Arg_B
chemistry	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
example,	Arg_I
merely	Arg_I
memorizing	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
names	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
substances	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
structural	Arg_I
formulas	Arg_I
seems	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
boring,	Arg_I
while	Arg_I
representing	Arg_I
where	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
chemical	Arg_I
reactions	Arg_I
really	Arg_I
happen	Arg_I
near	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
raise	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
curiosity	Arg_I

lead	Arg_I
them	Arg_I

those	Arg_I

school,	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
chemical	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
once	Arg_I

us	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
detergent	Arg_I
dissolves	Arg_I
oil	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
experiment	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
later	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
taught	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
describe	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
process	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
formal	Arg_I
structural	Arg_I
formulas	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
type	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
method	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
fun	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
eventually	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
results	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
good	Arg_I

I	Arg_B
connected	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
visual	Arg_I

that	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

though	Arg_I
now	Arg_I
I'm	Arg_I
not	Arg_I

Second,	O
by	Arg_B
bridging	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
theories	Arg_I

daily	Arg_I

This	Arg_B

For	O

in	Arg_B

students	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
informed	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
rights	Arg_I

using	O
life	O

keep	O
them	O

only	O

it	Arg_B
reinforces	Arg_I
students'	Arg_I
impression	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

tackling	Arg_B

whatever	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
civil	Arg_I
constructions	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
economic	Arg_I
achievements	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
end	Arg_I
up	Arg_I

we	Arg_B

all	Arg_I
perish	Arg_I

Second,	O
the	Arg_B
influence	Arg_I
on	Arg_I

issues	Arg_I

Environmental	Arg_B
problems	Arg_I

problems	Arg_I
seem	Arg_I
to	Arg_I

more	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
chronic	Arg_I
diseases	Arg_I
that	Arg_I

not	Arg_I
burst	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
away	Arg_I

However,	O
the	Arg_B
truth	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
we've	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
encountering	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
sighs	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
warnings	Arg_I

global	Arg_I
climate	Arg_I
anomalies	Arg_I

other	Arg_I
environmental	Arg_I

right	Arg_I
now	Arg_I

It	Arg_B
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
unwise	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
deny	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
truth	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
focusing	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
economic	Arg_I
developments	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
unfortunately,	Arg_I
usually	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
economic	Arg_I
developments	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
causes	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
environmental	Arg_I
damages	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
environmental	Arg_B
conservation	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I

economic	Arg_I

University	O

In	O
university	O
education,	O
students	O
are	O
given	O
much	O
independence	O
in	O
the	O
ways	O
of	O

Some	O
students	O
still	O
rely	O

keep	O
up	O

the	O
courses,	O
while	O
some	O
students	O
don't	O
feel	O
the	O
need	O
to	O
attend	O
classes	O
because	O
they	O
believe	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
handle	O
the	O

These	O
different	O
ideas	O
of	O

lead	O
to	O
a	O
question	O
whether	O
it	O

to	O
attend	O
the	O
class	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
they	O
can	O
pass	O
their	O
examinations	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
students	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
matter	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
outcome	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
in	Arg_B
terms	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
learning,	Arg_I
attending	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
effective	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
simply	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
alone	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
pass	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
exams	Arg_I
.	O
Classes	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
designed	Arg_I
diligently	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
professors	Arg_I
absolutely	Arg_I
bear	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
.	O
Professors	Arg_B
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
knowledge,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
equip	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
experiences,	Arg_I
knowing	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
guide	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
toward	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I
achievements	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
it's	Arg_B
students'	Arg_I
basic	Arg_I
responsibility	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
.	O
Attending	Arg_B
class	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
persuasive	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
show	Arg_I
respect	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
professor	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
.	O
Many	Arg_B
professors	Arg_I
grade	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
attendances	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
class	Arg_B
attendances	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
regarded	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
critical	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
examination	Arg_I
performances	Arg_I
.	O
Those	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
achieve	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
scores	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
exams	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
fail	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
didn't	Arg_I
show	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
.	O
Some	O
people	O
might	O
argue	O
that	O
if	Arg_B
students	Arg_I
already	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
contents	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
enough	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
pass	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
exams	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
.	O
Why	O
wasting	O
time	O
going	O
to	O
classes?	O
Doesn't	O
self-study	O
more	O
efficient?	O
However,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
this	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
rather	Arg_I
immodest	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
thinking	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
professors	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
experiences	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
qualifications	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
professors	Arg_I
.	O
Besides,	O
even	Arg_B
if	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
believe	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
brilliant	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
surpass	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
professors,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
discuss	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
professors	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
classmates	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
students	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
thoroughly	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
showing	Arg_I
respect	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
professors	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
through	Arg_I
attending	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
.	O
It's	Arg_B
an	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
process	Arg_I
.	O
Passing	O
the	O
exams	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
terminal	O
purpose	O
of	O
learning	O
.	O
The	O
learning	O
process	O
itself,	O
however,	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
and	O
powerful	O
way	O
of	O

a	O
student	O

I	O

To	O

famous	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
usually	Arg_I
diligent	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
lucky	Arg_I
people	Arg_I

Hard	Arg_B
work	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
professional	Arg_I
man/woman	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
powerful	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
mean,	O
when	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
decrease	Arg_I
portion	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
success	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example	O
in	Arg_B
football	Arg_I
game	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
said	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
penalty-kick	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
goal	Arg_I
.	O
Statically	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
goal	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
fifty-fifty	Arg_I
.	O
But	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
Ronaldo	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
goal	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
penalty-kick	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
possibility	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
Ronaldo	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
fortune	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
.	O
Definitely	Arg_B
it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
practice	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
exercise	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
.	O
He	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
exercise	O
in	O
football	O
field	O
every	O
day,	O
so	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
luckier	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
we	Arg_B
cannot	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
lean	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
luck	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
successful	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
don't	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
disavow	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
role	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
luck	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
success,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
hardly	Arg_I
accompany	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
.	O
So,	O
for	O
example	O
you	Arg_B
prepare	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
TOEFL	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
multiple-choice	Arg_I
test	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
four	Arg_I
option	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
choose	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
question	Arg_I
.	O
You	Arg_B
cannot	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
Rely	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
luck,	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
lucky	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
pick	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
choice	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
fail	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I

Undoubtedly	O
it	Arg_B

wise	Arg_I
advice	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
success	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I
.	O
Finally,	O
you	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
information	Arg_I
before	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
project	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
most	Arg_I
fortunate	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
word	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
manufacture	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
automobile	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
build	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
tower	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
.	O
These	Arg_B
plans	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
done	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
someone	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
mastered	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
his/her	Arg_I
work	Arg_I

Undoubtedly	O
such	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I

have	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
experiences	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
works	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
the	O
end,	O
I	O
think	O
any	O
great	O
success	O
need	O
great	O
work	O
not	O
great	O
luck,	O
even	O
though	O
luck	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
factor	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
reaching	Arg_I
goal	Arg_I
but	O
its	Arg_B
impact	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
extraneous	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
must	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
reckon	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
luck	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
plans	Arg_I
.	O

Sometimes	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
sometimes	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
Different	O
people	O
prefer	O
different	O
styles	O
of	O
learning	O
.	O
I	O
think	O
both	Arg_B
learning	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
myself	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
helpful	Arg_I
.	O
Learning	Arg_B
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
prevent	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
confused	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
rate	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
speed	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
.	O
Another	O
important	O
point	O
is	O
that	O
for	Arg_B
practical	Arg_I
subjects	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
sometimes	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
rather	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
.	O
A	Arg_B
good	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
experienced	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
faster	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
easier	Arg_I
.	O
Sometimes	Arg_B
when	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
myself	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
confusing	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
few	Arg_I
sources	Arg_I
available,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
discouraged	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
spending	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
situation,	Arg_I
I'll	Arg_I
look	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
request	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
.	O
And	Arg_B
then	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
she	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
teach	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
efficiently	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
short	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
and	O
therefore	O
I	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
faster	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
won't	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
discouraged	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
confused	Arg_I
.	O
There	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
practical	Arg_I
subjects	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
instructor	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
driving	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
car	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
jobs	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
medicine	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
engineering	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
sports	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
skiing	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
swimming,	Arg_I
you'll	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
.	O
It's	Arg_B
almost	Arg_I
impossible	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
inefficient	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
own	Arg_I

By	O
the	O
way,	O
if	O
you	O

going	O

learn	O
some	O
things	O
by	O
yourself,	O
you	O
may	O
learn	O

understand	O
them	O
incorrectly!	O
For	O
example,	O
from	Arg_B
my	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
experiences,	Arg_I
after	Arg_I

had	Arg_I
started	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
playing	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
guitar	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

wrong	Arg_I
habits	Arg_I
regarding	Arg_I
strumming	Arg_I

after	Arg_I
finding	Arg_I

learning	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
tutor	Arg_I

identifying	Arg_I

eliminating	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
incorrect	Arg_I

I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
play	Arg_I
properly	Arg_I

There	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
some	Arg_I

Once	O
you	O

Which	O
one	O

the	O

In	O
my	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
once	Arg_B
you	Arg_I

unique	Arg_I
enough,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
already	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
way	Arg_I

success	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
being	Arg_B
positively	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
everyone	Arg_I
else	Arg_I
usually	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
you've	Arg_I
achieved	Arg_I
something	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
superior	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
others	Arg_I
.	O
As	Arg_B
living	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
competent	Arg_I
world,	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
playing	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
survival	Arg_I
game	Arg_I
.	O
Only	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
sharpest	Arg_I
weapon	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
survive	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
yourself	Arg_I
outstanding	Arg_I
enough	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
fail	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
distinguish	Arg_I
yourself	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
others,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
easily	Arg_I
replaced	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
eliminated	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
someone	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
.	O
Take	O
myself	O
for	O
example,	O
when	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
college,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
chosen	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
presenter	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
report	Arg_I
because	O
I	Arg_B
was	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
present	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
report	Arg_I
thoroughly	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
fluently	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
being	Arg_B
unique	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
value	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
never	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
taken	Arg_I
by	Arg_I

In	O
other	O
words,	O
once	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
special	Arg_I

unique,	Arg_I
pursuing	Arg_I
success	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
matter	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
actively	Arg_I
creating	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
fashion	Arg_I
rather	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
passively	Arg_I
waiting	Arg_I

popular	Arg_I

prestigious	Arg_I
technology	Arg_I
company-	Arg_I
Apple-	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
example	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
reason	Arg_I
why	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
gains	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
tremendous	Arg_I
success	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
achieves	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
brilliant	Arg_I
qualities	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
never	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
caught	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
competitors	Arg_I

It	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
operating	Arg_I
systems	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
run	Arg_I
smoother	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
companies	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
design	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
wins	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

In	O
conclusion,	O

the	Arg_I

Under	O
this	O

When	Arg_B

brilliant	Arg_I
paintings,	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
Mona	Arg_I

people	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
put	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

down	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
ground	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I

mysterious	Arg_I

this	Arg_I

At	O
this	O

they	Arg_B

Apparently,	O
this	Arg_B
sense	Arg_I
towards	Arg_I

is	Arg_I
built	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
initial	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
.	O
Admittedly,	O
the	Arg_B
study	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
art	Arg_I

music	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
supposed	Arg_I
to	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
education	Arg_I

the	Arg_B

cultivate	Arg_I

my	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
every	Arg_B

between	Arg_I

alters	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
especially	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
challenges	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
generation	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
significantly	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
last	Arg_I
generation	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
under	Arg_B
globalization	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
industrial	Arg_I
integration,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
work-related	Arg_I
challenges	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
generation	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
getting	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
complicated	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
challenging	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
successful	O
people	O
are	O
those	O
who	O
can	O
quickly	O
respond	O
to	O
this	O
rapid-changing	O
world	O
.	O
In	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
past,	Arg_I
focusing	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
skill	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
enough	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
deal	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
because	O
every	Arg_B
industry	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
rather	Arg_I
small	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
size	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
simple	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
manage	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
as	Arg_B
those	Arg_I
industries	Arg_I
expand	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
internationalized,	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
required	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
equip	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
multiple	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
answer	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
challenges	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
now	O
there	O
are	O
more	O
chances	O
to	O
do	O
business	O
with	O
people	O
around	O
the	O
world,	O
so	O
besides	Arg_B
one's	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
profession,	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
ability	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
another	O
example,	O
financial	O
crimes	O
are	O
rampant	O
in	O
the	O
21st	O
century,	O
thus	O
surging	Arg_B
up	Arg_I
demands	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
excel	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
both	Arg_I
laws	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
financial	Arg_I
management	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
this	Arg_B
generation	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
encountering	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
self-recognition	Arg_I
issue	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
experienced	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
previous	Arg_I
generation	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
past	Arg_I
generation	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
given	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
freedom	Arg_I

was	Arg_I
usually	Arg_I
asked	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
follow	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
paths	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
prepared	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
contrast,	O
young	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
generation	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
exposed	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
creative	Arg_I
ideas	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
rather	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
individually	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
eager	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
finding	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
really	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
fortunate	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
struggle	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
sweet	Arg_I
worries	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
worries	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
indeed	Arg_I
never	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
decisions	Arg_I
between	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
possibilities	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
responsible	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
taking	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
consequences	Arg_I

In	O
conclusion,	O
challenges	Arg_B
for	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
generation	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
complicated	Arg_I

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
main	O
reasons	O
for	O
supporting	O
this	O
statement	O
is	O
that	O
successful	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
points	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
trying	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
other	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
great	Arg_B
success	Arg_I
requires	Arg_I
taking	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
risks	Arg_I
.	O
There	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
interesting	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
useful	Arg_I
experiences	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
successful	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
trying	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
act	Arg_I
effectively	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
communicating	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
people,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
try	Arg_I
something	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
salesmanship	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
various	Arg_I
stores	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
places	Arg_I
.	O
By	Arg_B
selling	Arg_I
goods	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
commodities	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
face	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
behaviors	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
personalities	Arg_I
and	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
you	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
behave	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
situations	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
jobs	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
.	O
These	Arg_B
experiences	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
obtained	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
trying	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
can’t	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
found	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
books	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
great	Arg_B
success	Arg_I
requires	Arg_I
taking	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
risks	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
gain	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
profits	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
investments,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
amounts	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
risky	Arg_I
financial	Arg_I
decisions	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
dealings	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
lose	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
achieve	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
remarkable	Arg_I
success	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
exam,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
risk	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
sacrificing	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
free	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
favorite	Arg_I
hobbies	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
more	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
risks,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
greater	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
successes	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
don’t	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
risks,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
ordinary	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
average	Arg_I
successes	Arg_I
.	O
That’s	O
why	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
risks	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
sum,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
success	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
trying	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
taking	Arg_I
risks	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
hand	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
hand	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
achieve	Arg_I
success	Arg_I
you	Arg_I

agree	O
that	O
Television	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
destroyed	Arg_I
communication	Arg_I
among	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I

family	Arg_I
.	O
Some	Arg_B

spend	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I

time	Arg_I
watching	Arg_I

others	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
eat	Arg_I
watching	Arg_I
television,	Arg_I

some	Arg_I

make	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
this	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
priority	Arg_I

First	O
of	O
all,	O
some	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
watching	Arg_I
television	Arg_I
.	O
Instead	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
friends,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
seat	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
chair	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
hours	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
know	Arg_I
someone	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
wakes	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
morning	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
before	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
eat	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
turns	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
television	Arg_I
on,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
records	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
watch	Arg_I
during	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
hours	Arg_I
.	O
Sometimes	Arg_B
his	Arg_I
wife	Arg_I
wants	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
talk	Arg_I
before	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
let	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
talk	Arg_I
during	Arg_I
commercials	Arg_I
.	O
So,	O
she	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
habit	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
she	Arg_I
prefers	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
write	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
email	Arg_I
.	O
Time	Arg_B
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
gold,	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
realize	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
talk	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
Another	Arg_B
way	Arg_I
television	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
destroyed	Arg_I
communication	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
seat	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
table	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
dinner	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
time,	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
children,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
share	Arg_I
everything	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
school,	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
project	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
concerns	Arg_I

Also,	O
when	Arg_B
there	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
dinner	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
friends,	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
fluid	Arg_I
conversation	Arg_I
because	O
the	Arg_B
television	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
again	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
between	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
When	Arg_B
family	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
gather	Arg_I
together	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
eating	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
talking,	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
reality	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
cases	Arg_I
.	O
Finally,	O
some	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
television	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
priority	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
remember	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
told	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
she	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
watching	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
telenovela	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
house	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
certain	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
during	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
night	Arg_I
.	O
Honestly,	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
shock!	O
How	O
she	O
could	O
say	O
that	O
to	O
me?	O
.	O
As	O
I	O
have	O
said,	O
television	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
tool	O
to	O
learn,	O
entertain	O
and	O
inform	O
what	O
is	O
happening,	O
but	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
television	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
destroyed	Arg_I
communication	Arg_I
among	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
soon	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
television	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
priority,	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
watching	Arg_I
it	Arg_I

eat	Arg_I

Spending	O

I	Arg_B

my	Arg_B

a	Arg_I

What	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

First	O
and	O
foremost,	O
I	O
truly	O
believe	O
that	O
being	Arg_B

provide	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
opportunity	Arg_I

However,	O
if	Arg_B

that	O

the	Arg_I

after	Arg_I
that	Arg_I

In	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
way	Arg_I

Finally	O
yet	O

Through	O

I	Arg_B

these	Arg_I

people,	Arg_I
who	Arg_I

Unlike	Arg_B
email,	Arg_I
send	Arg_I
message	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
using	Arg_I
mail	Arg_I
service	Arg_I
could	Arg_I

lost	Arg_I

could	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
sent	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
wrong	Arg_I
address	Arg_I

I	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
using	Arg_I
telephones	Arg_I

email	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
talk	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
write	Arg_I
directly	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
connect	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
right	O
now,	O
I	O
am	O
in	O
the	O
U	O
.S	O
.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
possible	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
conversation	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
parents,	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
live	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
country	Arg_I

Consequently,	O
I	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
phone	Arg_I
call	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
write	Arg_I
email	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
whenever	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
want	Arg_I

Telephones	Arg_B

email	Arg_I
made	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
close	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
using	Arg_B
telephones	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
email	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
express	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
words	Arg_I
better	Arg_I

face-to-face	Arg_I
communication	Arg_I

For	O
instant,	O
sometime	Arg_B
when	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
argue	Arg_I

my	Arg_I
friends,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
express	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
self	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
moment	Arg_I

So,	O
when	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
realize	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
happened,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
explain	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
want	Arg_I

express	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
emotion	Arg_I

Thus,	O
these	Arg_B
types	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
communications	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
personal	Arg_I
.	O
Telephones	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
email	Arg_I
make	Arg_I

Beside,	O
I	Arg_B

thought	Arg_I
through	Arg_I
telephones	Arg_I

As	O
a	O
result,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
telephones	Arg_B

more	Arg_I
likely	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
accomplish	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
purpose	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
concentrating	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
already	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
well,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
.	O
When	Arg_B
you're	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
something	Arg_I
well,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
satisfied	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
interested	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
.	O
Then,	O
you	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
motivate	Arg_I
yourself	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
give	O
an	O
example,	O
I	Arg_B
used	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
math	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
junior	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
.	O
Because	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
preferably,	O
I	Arg_B
became	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
absorb	Arg_I
myself	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
try	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
advanced	Arg_I
level	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
math	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
I	Arg_B
could	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
higher	Arg_I
scores	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
math	Arg_I
test	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
solve	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
university-level	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I

Thus,	O
by	Arg_B
doing	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
at,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
summary,	O
doing	Arg_B
what	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
already	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
helps	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
big	Arg_I
accomplishment	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
much	Arg_I

I	Arg_B
asked	Arg_I
my	Arg_I

he	Arg_I
refuse	Arg_I

give	Arg_I
it	Arg_I

I	Arg_B

our	O

from	O
their	O

I	O
will	O
give	O
reasons	O

my	O
opinion	O

First,	O
dancing	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
significant	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
show	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
something	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
believe	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
some	Arg_B
culture	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
believe	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
dance	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
order	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
sacrifice	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
god	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
Or	Arg_B
some	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
arid	Arg_I
area	Arg_I
believe	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
danced,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
rain	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
come	Arg_I
.	O
Consequently,	O
dancing	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
belief	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
dancing	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
represent	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
civilization	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
seen	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
western	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
kingdom	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
visitor	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
another	Arg_I
kingdom,	Arg_I
king	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
queen	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
dance	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
show	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
splendid	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
kingdom	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
way	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
movement,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
costume	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
while	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
dance	Arg_I
.	O
All	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
civilization	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
.	O
Thirdly,	O
many	Arg_B
culture,	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
ways	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
entertain	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
.	O
And	O
dancing	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
ways	Arg_I
.	O
Both	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
see	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
dance	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
many	Arg_B
event,	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
christmas,	Arg_I
last	Arg_I
christmas	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
went	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
mall	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
buy	Arg_I
gifts,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
entertained	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
santa	Arg_I
custom	Arg_I
dancing	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
christmas	Arg_I
song	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
felt	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
around	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
santas	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
see	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
strongly	O
agree	O
with	O
notion	O
that	O
dancing	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
because	O
dancing	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
represent	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
believe	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
.	O
Besides,	O
dancing	Arg_B
could	Arg_I
show	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
civilization	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
people	Arg_B
use	Arg_I
dancing	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
entertain	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
.	O
So	O
dancing	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
.	O

the	Arg_B

provides	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

of	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
information	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
latter	O
because	O
the	Arg_B
internet	Arg_I
gives	Arg_I
daily	Arg_I
necessary	Arg_I
information,	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
gain	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
explore	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world	Arg_I

First	O
of	O
all,	O
everybody	Arg_B
would	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
going	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
around	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
everyday	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I

Sometimes,	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
information	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
daily	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
internet	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
provide	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
people	Arg_I

For	O

a	Arg_B
businessman	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
watch	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

check	Arg_I
stock	Arg_I
markets	Arg_I
easily	Arg_I
via	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

In	O
addition,	O
people	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
gain	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
using	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
internet,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
useful	Arg_I
technology	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
.	O
Many	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
online	Arg_I
courses	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
study	Arg_I

them	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I

Not	Arg_B
only	Arg_I
students	Arg_I

also	Arg_I
everyone	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
information	Arg_I

For	O

people	Arg_B
who	Arg_I

their	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
search	Arg_I

about	Arg_I
it	Arg_I

Last	O
but	O
not	O

The	Arg_B
internet	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world	Arg_I

smaller	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
thing	Arg_I

This	O

people	Arg_B
who	Arg_I

In	O
my	O
point	O

view,	O
studying	Arg_B
many	Arg_I

better	Arg_I
that	Arg_I

all,	O
when	Arg_B

This	O

they	Arg_B

Therefore,	O
requiring	Arg_B

For	O

these	O

nothing	O

Therefore,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
accede	O
with	O
notion	O
that	O
government	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
pay	Arg_I
attention	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
basic	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
first	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
as	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
after	Arg_B
great	Arg_I
economic	Arg_I
recession,	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
were	Arg_I
unemployed	Arg_I
.	O
Then,	O
many	O
people	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
money	O
.	O
When	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
did	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
money,	Arg_I
They	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
rob	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
.	O
There	Arg_B
were	Arg_I
increasing	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
criminal	Arg_I
rate	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
cities	Arg_I
.	O
Consequently,	O
quality	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
were	Arg_I
dropping	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
unhappy	Arg_I
.	O
So	O
that,	O
government	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
invest	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
jobs	Arg_I
.	O
When	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
jobs,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
did	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
steal	Arg_I
money	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
criminal	Arg_B
rate	Arg_I
were	Arg_I
drop	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
people	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
environment	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
issue	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
everyone	Arg_I
depend	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
.	O
Nowaday,	O
industrial	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
emit	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
intense	Arg_I

every	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
creature	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

So,	O
government	Arg_B
take	Arg_I
care	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
issue	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
declare	Arg_I
regulate	Arg_I

control	Arg_I
emission	Arg_I

carbon	Arg_I

.	O
In	O
addition	O
to	O
controlling	O
emission	O
carbon	O

government	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
invest	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
alternative	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
using	Arg_I
solar	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
instead	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
coal	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
we	Arg_I
lived	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
environment,	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
.	O
Lastly,	O
family	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
root	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
society	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
everyone	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
did	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
other,	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
problems,	Arg_I
If	Arg_I
family	Arg_I

it	Arg_I

society	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I

When	Arg_B
society	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
problems,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
impact	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
nation	Arg_I

Thus,	O
government	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
campaign	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
fill	Arg_I
love	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
family	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
setting	Arg_B
event	Arg_I
once	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
week	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
gather	Arg_I
everyone	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
each	Arg_I

When	Arg_B
family	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
each	Arg_I

it	Arg_I
mean	Arg_I
society	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
nation	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
trouble	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
personally	O
agree	O
with	O
statement	O
that	O
government	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
basic	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I

The	O
basic	O
needs:	O
jobs,	O
good	O

and	O
love	O

These	Arg_B
three	Arg_I
issues	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
basic	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
opinion	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
pay	Arg_I
attention	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I

Best	O
ways	O
of	O
reducing	O
stress:	O
listening	O
to	O
music,	O
exercise,	O
meditation	O
Nowadays,	O
we	O
are	O
living	O
in	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
which	O
is	O
absolutely	O
complicated	O
.	O
Everything	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
rush,	O
and	O
it	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
competition	O
.	O
These	O
make	O
people	O
get	O
stress	O
.	O
Thus,	O
many	O
people	O
try	O
to	O
reduce	O
their	O
stress	O
.	O
There	O
are	O
many	O
activities	O
that	O
could	O
relieve	O
those	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
in	O
stress	O
.	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
reducing	Arg_B
stress	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
listening	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
music,	Arg_I
playing	Arg_I
sports,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
meditation	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
practical	Arg_I
ways	Arg_I
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
listening	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
relax	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
when	O
I	O
go	O
to	O
office,	O
I	O
use	O
public	O
transport	O
.	O
I	O
see	O
many	O
things	O
such	O
as	O
traffic	O
jam,	O
crowded	O
people	O
at	O
bus	O
stop,	O
and	O
all	O
so	O
crowded	O
people	O
in	O
buses	O
.	O
These	O
make	O
me	O
stress	O
.	O
So	O
that	O
I	Arg_B
always	Arg_I
listen	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
mp3	Arg_I
player	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
could	Arg_I
enjoy	Arg_I
listening	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
thinking	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
around	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
.	O
Consequently,	O
I	Arg_B
feel	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
listen	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
another	Arg_B
way	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
perfectly	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
everyone	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
reduce	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
exercise	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	O
alway	O
have	O
many	O
things	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
such	O
as	O
a	O
difficult	O
of	O
my	O
work	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
finish	O
in	O
time	O
.	O
These	O
problem	O
sometime	O
make	O
me	O
hard	O
to	O
fall	O
asleep	O
because	O
it	O
make	O
me	O
stress	O
.	O
Thus,	O
after	Arg_B
work,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
exercise,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
jogging	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
favorite	Arg_I
sport	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
feel	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
out,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
am	Arg_I
easily	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
fall	Arg_I
asleep	Arg_I
.	O
Exercising	Arg_B
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
reduce	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
.	O
Third,	O
meditation	Arg_B
also	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
ways	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
reduce	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
.	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
many	O
things	O
to	O
think	O
about,	O
and	O
this	O
make	O
me	O
stress,	O
I	O
will	O
do	O
meditation	O
.	O
Meditation	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
relax	Arg_I
because	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
require	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
equipment,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
few	Arg_I
minutes	Arg_I
.	O
A	Arg_B
way	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
meditation	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
sit	Arg_I
down,	Arg_I
close	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
eyes,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
count	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
breath	Arg_I
.	O
These	Arg_B
could	Arg_I
relieve	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
ways	O
to	O
reduce	O
the	O
stress	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
listening	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
music,	Arg_I
exercising,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
meditation	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
escape	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
usable	Arg_I
.	O
And	Arg_B
everyone	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
physically	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
everyone	Arg_I
mind	Arg_I
.	O

Should	O
teachers	O
be	O
paid	O
according	O
to	O
how	O
much	O
their	O
students	O
learn?	O
Everyone	O
is	O
different	O
.	O
Although	O
students	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
process	O
of	O
education	O

learning	O
abilities	O
in	O
each	O
students	O

.	O
Some	O
students	O
are	O
fast	O
learner,	O
but	O
some	O
students	O
are	O
not	O

Thus,	O
paying	Arg_B
for	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
base	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
grade	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
got	Arg_I

it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
fair	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
.	O
So	O
that,	O
I	O
disagree	O
with	O
this	O

To	O
begin	O
with,	O
in	O
schools,	O
main	Arg_B
task	Arg_I

to	Arg_I
give	Arg_I

this	Arg_I

there	Arg_B

Second,	O

Lastly,	O

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	Arg_B

Besides,	O
learning	Arg_B
abilities	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
there	Arg_B

problems	Arg_I

Should	O
good	O
people	O
are	O
rewarded	O

bad	O
people	O
are	O
punished	O
in	O
movies	O
or	O
dramas?	O
When	O
we	O
watch	O
movies	O
or	O
dramas,	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
like	O

good	O

a	O

some	O

this	O

Personally,	O
I	O
prefer	O
to	O
see	O
good	O
people	O
get	O

However,	O
if	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
ending,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
don’t	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
it’s	Arg_I
proper	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
if	Arg_B
all	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
story	Arg_I
end	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
way,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
boring	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
good	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
win,	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
guess	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
ending	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
dramas	Arg_I
.	O
Then	Arg_B
we	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
interested	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
But	Arg_B
if	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
rewarded,	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
try	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
finish	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
movie	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
dramas	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
end	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
story	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
Hollywood	Arg_B
stories	Arg_I
usually	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
ending	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
hero	Arg_I
beats	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
crime	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
girl	Arg_I
.	O
But	Arg_B
now	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
people,	Arg_I
including	Arg_I
me,	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
tired	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
don’t	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
see	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
kind	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
ending	Arg_I
again	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
again	Arg_I
.	O
So	O
we	Arg_B
can’t	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
let	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
rewarded	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
TV	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
.	O
Even	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
real	Arg_I
world,	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
bad	Arg_I
ending	Arg_I
sometimes	Arg_I
.	O
And	O
I	O
think	O
it	Arg_B
happen	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
often	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
real	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
.	O
So	O
if	Arg_B
children	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
watch	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
TV	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
rewarded,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
true	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
real	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
misleading	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
.	O
And	O
they	Arg_B
may	Arg_I
act	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
order	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
reward	Arg_I
.	O
Once	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
rewarded,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
upset	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
.	O
But	O
in	O
fact,	O
the	Arg_B
good	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
matter	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
ending	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
.	O
So	O
we	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
tell	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
avoid	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
misunderstanding	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
those	Arg_B
good	Arg_I
endings	Arg_I
sometimes	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
helpful	Arg_I
.	O
Some	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
encouraged	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
.	O
But	O
like	O
I	O
said,	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
behavior	O
won’t	O
last	O
long,	O
because	O
someday	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
realize	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
truth	Arg_I
.	O
So	O
I	O
suggest	O
we	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
show	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
truth	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
stories	Arg_I
.	O
And	O
if	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
can,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
matter	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
story	Arg_I
ends	Arg_I
.	O
Based	O
on	O
my	O
arguments	O
above,	O
I	O
think	O
movies	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
TV	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
present	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
stories	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
reward	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
nothing	Arg_I
.	O

Should	O

computer	O
classes?	O
There	O
are	O
many	O
advantages	O

it	Arg_B

Learning	Arg_B

Besides,	O
learning	Arg_B

Consequently,	O
I	Arg_B

Secondly,	O

For	O
instance,	O
In	Arg_B

Lastly,	O

This	Arg_B

Besides,	O
classroom	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
news	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
choosing	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

keep	Arg_I

Thus,	O
I	Arg_B
am	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
buy	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I

food	Arg_I

This	Arg_B
food	Arg_I

One	O
important	O
thing	O
that	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
change	O
about	O
my	O
hometown	O
Public	O
utilities	O

are	O
the	O
primary	O
factors	O
which	O
we	O
basically	O
consider	O
before	O
we	O
decide	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
a	O
place	O

However,	O
it	O
is	O
difficult	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
community	O
which	O
can	O
perfectly	O
meet	O
our	O
requirements	O

In	O
my	O

there	O
are	O
almost	O
complete	O
public	O
utilities	O
for	O
one’s	O

transportation	O

So	O
the	Arg_B
thing	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
really	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
change	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
.	O
Since	O
I’m	Arg_B
facing	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
traffic	Arg_I
congestion	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
.	O
And	O
this	O
problem	O
seem	O
to	O
get	O
worst	O
.	O
At	O
first,	O
it	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
alternatives	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transportation,	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
subway	Arg_I
train	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
sky	Arg_I
train	Arg_I
.	O
Hence,	O
people	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
ways	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
place	Arg_I
.	O
Since	O
now	O
buses	O
are	O
only	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
public	O
transportation	O
in	O
this	O
community,	O
It	Arg_B
makes	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
area	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
choice	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
must	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
bus	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
another	Arg_I
place	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
subway	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
sky	Arg_I
train	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
available	Arg_I
here,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
convenience	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
them	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
people	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
estimate	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
taking	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
subway	Arg_I
train	Arg_I
due	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
train	Arg_I
schedule	Arg_I
.	O
On	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
contrary	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
case	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
bus	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
this	Arg_B
improvement	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
decrease	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
bad	Arg_I
traffic	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
road	Arg_I
indirectly	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
the	Arg_B
buses	Arg_I
provide	Arg_I
merely	Arg_I
two	Arg_I
routes	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
community	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
absolutely	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
major	Arg_I
problem	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
place	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
intend	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
route	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
buses,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
bus	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
does	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
bring	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
destination	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
center	Arg_I
station	Arg_I
first	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
exchange	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
another	Arg_I
bus	Arg_I
.	O
Obviously,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
waste	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
routes	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
transport	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
easily	Arg_I
.	O
Lastly,	O
having	Arg_B
more	Arg_I
kinds	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
dwindle	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
using	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
cars	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
it	O
provides	O
many	O
advantages	O
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
people	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
save	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
expenses	Arg_I
form	Arg_I
gasoline,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
nowadays	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
getting	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
expensive	Arg_I

The	O
necessary	O
energy	O

slowly	O
be	O
used	O
up,	O
since	O
people	Arg_B
use	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
cars	Arg_I

To	O
sum	O
up,	O
the	Arg_B
transportation	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
elementary	Arg_I
factor	Arg_I
which	Arg_I

work	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
large	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
First,	O
to	Arg_B
find	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
large	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
easier	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
small	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
.	O
Large	Arg_B
companies	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
look	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
skilled	Arg_I
employees	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
fill	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
distributing,	Arg_I
managing	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
selling	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
products	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
if	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
large	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
decides	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
open	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
branch	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
country,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
more	Arg_I

in	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
there	Arg_I

In	O

Large	Arg_B
company	Arg_I
equals	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
opportunity	Arg_I

Second,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
a	Arg_B
large	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
salaries	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

one	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
fact	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
large	Arg_I
one,	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
it's	Arg_I
having	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
considerable	Arg_I
success	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
this	Arg_B
means	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
company	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
salaries	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
employees	Arg_I
.	O
For	O

common	Arg_B

that	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
famous	Arg_I

international	Arg_I

company	Arg_I
won't	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I

as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

local	Arg_I

Third,	O
I	O
love	O

the	O

large	Arg_B
companies	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
international	Arg_I

as	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
organize	Arg_I
international	Arg_I
conferences,	Arg_I

Recent	Arg_B

this	Arg_B

a	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
team	Arg_B

may	Arg_I

different	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
need	Arg_I

Obviously,	O
discussion	Arg_B

a	Arg_I

An	Arg_B
experiment	Arg_I
conducted	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
Beijing	Arg_I
University	Arg_I
asked	Arg_I
two	Arg_I
groups	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
discuss	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
budget	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
activity	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
first	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
asked	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
discuss	Arg_I

while	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
second	Arg_I
group	Arg_I

asked	Arg_I

discuss	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
email	Arg_I

The	O
result	O
shows	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
1st	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
30	Arg_I
minutes	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
reach	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
agreement	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
budget,	Arg_I
while	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
takes	Arg_I
30	Arg_I
hours	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
later	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
similar	Arg_I
experiment	Arg_I
done	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
other	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

people	Arg_I
can	Arg_I

quickly	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
talk	Arg_I

each	Arg_I
other	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
work	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
indirectly	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
efficiency	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
project	Arg_I
because	O
there	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
conflicts	Arg_I

fight	Arg_I
amongst	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
team	Arg_I
members	Arg_I
.	O
Writing	O
an	O
email	O
for	O
an	O
informal	O
matter	O
will	O
make	O
that	O
matter	O
looks	O
official,	O
therefore	O
people	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
receives	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
email	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
nervous	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
maybe	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
offended	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
words	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
writing	Arg_I

While	O
if	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
words	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
expressed	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
talking,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
counterparty	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
relaxed	Arg_I
since	O
their	Arg_B
response	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
recorded	Arg_I

they	Arg_I

misunderstand	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
informal	Arg_I
discussion	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
official	Arg_I
claim	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
less	Arg_B
misunderstanding	Arg_I
leads	Arg_I

less	Arg_I
conflicts	Arg_I

enhance	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
communication	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

Admittedly,	O
sometimes	Arg_B
we	Arg_I

Although	O
emails	Arg_B

convenient	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
work	Arg_I

it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
none	Arg_I

Since	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
classroom	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
campus	Arg_I
projects,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
few	Arg_I
possibility	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
project	Arg_I

located	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
areas	Arg_I

While	O
we	Arg_B

a	Arg_I
project,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I

numerous	Arg_I

if	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
opinion	Arg_I

there	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
hundreds	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
know	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	Arg_B
prefer	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
project	Arg_I
members	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
rather	Arg_I
them	Arg_I

First	O
of	O
all,	O
doing	Arg_B

addition,	O
by	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
latest	Arg_I

I	Arg_B
still	Arg_I

my	Arg_I

several	Arg_I
research	Arg_I
projects	Arg_I
when	Arg_I

Although	O
my	Arg_B

Secondly,	O
professors	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

It	Arg_B

of	O
the	O
learning	Arg_B
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
ask	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
related	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
studies	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
when	Arg_B
we	Arg_I
encounter	Arg_I
difficulty	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
out,	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
asking	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
difficulty	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
propitious	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
solve	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
instantly	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
professors	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
experience	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
knowledge,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
dextrous	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
letting	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
know	Arg_I
something	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
incorporated	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
materials	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
books	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
webpages	Arg_I
.	O
Hence	O
I,	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
class,	Arg_I
often	Arg_I
communicate	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
coordinated	Arg_I
answer	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
faced	Arg_I
problem,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
classmates	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
accustomed	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
communicating	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
in	O
my	O
mind,	O
the	Arg_B
learning	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
efficient	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
myself	Arg_I
.	O
We	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
accomplish	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
assignments	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
little	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
within	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
ourself	Arg_I
.	O
Furthermore,	O
the	Arg_B
teachers	Arg_I
play	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
role	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
leading	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
direction	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
This	Arg_B
gives	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
opportunity	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
rise	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
educational	Arg_I
level	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
exited	Arg_I
degree	Arg_I
.	O
knowledge	Arg_B
may	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
thereby	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
improved	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
strengthened	Arg_I
.	O
Finally,	O
of	O
course,	O
being	Arg_B
without	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
shortcomings	Arg_I
.	O
Notable	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
shortcomings	O
is	O
that	O
if	Arg_B
someone	Arg_I
faced	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
complicated	Arg_I
confusion	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
endeavors	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
making	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
were	Arg_I
miscarried,	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
might	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
ended	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
disappointment	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
for	Arg_B
one	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
depends	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
himself	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
learning,	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
improvement	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
ability,	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
regard	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
cooperation	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
express	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
opinion,	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
unpromising	Arg_I
.	O
Hence	O
I	Arg_B
support	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
point	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
better	Arg_I

it	Arg_B

For	O

I	Arg_B
use	Arg_I

I	Arg_I

It's	O

From	O
the	O

the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
the	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

Also,	O
I	O
think	O
its	Arg_B
better	Arg_I
that	Arg_I

learn	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I

in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

The	O
reasons	O

that	O
opinion	O
are	O

the	O

paragraphs	O

First	O
of	O
all,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
possible	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
everyone	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
visit	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
as	O
it	Arg_B
requires	Arg_I
large	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
legal	Arg_I
formalities	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
earlier	Arg_I
periods,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
languge	Arg_I
.	O
But	O
with	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
advent	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
globalization,	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
easily	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
in	Arg_B
Indian	Arg_I
sub-continent	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
large	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
centers	Arg_I
opened	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
getting	Arg_I
trained	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
variety	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
languages	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
french,	Arg_I
german	Arg_I
etc	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
colleges	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
universities	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
introduced	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
curriculum	Arg_I
.	O
Students	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
choose	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
set	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
languages	Arg_I
available	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
.	O
So,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
highly	Arg_B
qualified	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
easily	Arg_I
accessible	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
various	Arg_I
schools	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
colleges	Arg_I
.	O
Third,	O
technology	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
played	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
role	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
reducing	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
separation	Arg_I
between	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
languge	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
country	Arg_I

A	Arg_B
large	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
courses	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
available	Arg_I
online	Arg_I

there	Arg_I

on	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
languages	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
cost	Arg_I
effective	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
pool	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
opportunities	Arg_I
available	Arg_I
now	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
accomplish	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
.	O

One	O
long	O
vacation	O
or	O
several	O
long	O

Everybody	O
require	O
some	O

likewise	O
students	O
also	O
require	O
vacation	O
form	O
their	O
intense	O
academic	O
schedules	O

Many	O
people	O
promote	O
one	O
long	O
vacation	O
system	O
of	O
the	O
school	O
because	O
it	O
would	O
help	O
student	O
to	O
start	O
their	O
course	O
or	O
academic	O
year	O
with	O
strong	O
zeal	O
of	O
learning	O
.	O
So	O
other	O
several,	O
prefer	O
numbers	O
of	O
short	O
breaks	O
during	O
the	O
year	O
so	O
that	O
student	O
can	O
get	O
rejuvenate	O
periodically	O
.	O
In	O
both	O
the	O
scenario	O
students	O
relief	O
themselves	O
.	O
However,	O
i	Arg_B
discern	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
small	Arg_I
breaks	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
active	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
academics	Arg_I
.	O
Firstly,	O
several	Arg_B
vacations	Arg_I
throughout	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
year	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
level	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
low	Arg_I
.	O
Many	Arg_B
educational	Arg_I
bodies	Arg_I
schedule	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
small	Arg_I
vacations	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
term	Arg_I
exams	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
student's	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
relief	Arg_I
form	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I
pressure	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
research	Arg_B
done	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
universities	Arg_I
proves	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
student's	Arg_I
performance	Arg_I
improves	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
regular	Arg_I
breaks	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
learning,	Arg_I
preparation	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
examination	Arg_I
schedule	Arg_I
.	O
Many	Arg_B
colleges	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
provide	Arg_I
vacations	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
semester	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
facilitate	Arg_I
student	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
entertain	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
next	Arg_I
semester	Arg_I
.	O
Also	O
several	Arg_B
holidays	Arg_I
aid	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
amuse	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
arrange	Arg_I
fund	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
materials	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
books	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
references	Arg_I
material	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
upcoming	Arg_I
course	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
scientific	O
research	O
provide	O
several	O
authentic	O
survey	O
of	O
the	O
students'	O
performance	O
after	O
break	O

It	O
states	O
that	O
students	Arg_B

capability	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
having	Arg_I
refreshing	Arg_I
vacation	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
quote	O
an	O
instance,	O
in	Arg_B
my	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
vacations	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
quarterly	Arg_I
exams	Arg_I
.	O
During	Arg_B
those	Arg_I
vacations	Arg_I
i	Arg_I
used	Arg_I

analyze	Arg_I
my	Arg_I

in	Arg_I
latest	Arg_I
examination	Arg_I

used	Arg_I

again	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
avoid	Arg_I
making	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
mistakes	Arg_I

I	Arg_B
also	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
developing	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
recreational	Arg_I
activity	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
sports	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
game	Arg_I
.	O
During	Arg_B
my	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
vacations,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
miss	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
due	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
restart	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
session	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
enthusiasm	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
scoring	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
marks	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
quarter	Arg_I
.	O
Vacations	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
required	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
professionals	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
housekeepers	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
it	Arg_B
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
provide	Arg_I
break	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
regular	Arg_I
commitment	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
allows	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
themselves,	Arg_I
heel	Arg_I
stressful	Arg_I

boost	Arg_I
desire	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
resuming	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
regular	Arg_I
schedule	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore	O
schools	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
consider	Arg_I
giving	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
small	Arg_I
vocations	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

the	O

your	O

Im	O
my	O
opinion,	O
saving	Arg_B
some	Arg_I
part	Arg_I

your	Arg_I

essential	Arg_I

neither	Arg_I

your	Arg_I

First,	O
there	Arg_B

several	Arg_I

your	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
global	Arg_I
economic	Arg_I
conditions	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
days	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
tough	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
unpredictable	Arg_I
factors	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
necessary	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
bank	Arg_I
account	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
example	O
I	Arg_B
remember	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
lost	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
economic	Arg_I

them	O

no	O

not	O

the	O

they	Arg_B

move	Arg_I
back	Arg_I

their	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
lost	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

In	O
addition,	O
you	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
sure	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
development	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
personal	Arg_I
life	Arg_I

It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
possible	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
unavoidable	Arg_I
expenses	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
you	Arg_I

not	Arg_I
afford	Arg_I
without	Arg_I

Back	Arg_B

a	Arg_I

mine	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
little	Arg_I
savings	Arg_I

Finally,	O
with	Arg_B

you	Arg_I

Working	Arg_B
hard	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
saving	Arg_I

at	O

because	O
living	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
hurry	Arg_I
comes	Arg_I
along	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
disadvantages	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
living	Arg_B
your	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
fast	Arg_I
lane	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
stressful	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
affect	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
hurried	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
certain	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
off,	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
body	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
react	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
stressful	Arg_I
lifestyle	Arg_I
.	O
Many	O
hardworking	O
people	O
have	O
diseases,	O
like	O
the	O
burn-out	O
syndrome,	O
because	O
their	Arg_B
bodies	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
hold	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
pace	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
my	Arg_B
father	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
breakdown	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
years	Arg_I
ago	Arg_I
due	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
stressful	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
.	O
After	Arg_B
several	Arg_I
weeks	Arg_I
off	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
body	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
restored,	Arg_I
now	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
reduced	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
tempo	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
lifestyle	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
fine	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
living	Arg_B
your	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
slower	Arg_I
pace	Arg_I
increases	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
happiness	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
facing	Arg_I
excessive	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
care	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
beloved's	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
hurry	Arg_I
yourself	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
.	O
Caring	Arg_B
for	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
social	Arg_I
environment	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
happiness	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
reduce	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
stress	Arg_I
level	Arg_I
.	O
For	O

a	O

mine	O
lives	O
at	O
a	O
slow	O
pace	O

his	Arg_I

cultivate	Arg_I
his	Arg_I

you	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
likely	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I

errors	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
mistakes	Arg_I
.	O
Doing	Arg_B
tasks	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
hurry	Arg_I

you	Arg_B

To	O

I	O
once	O
wrote	O
an	O
essay	O
in	O
a	O

In	O
my	O

we	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

According	O

my	O

Therefore,	O
I	O
strongly	O

that	O

some	Arg_B

Further,	O

It	Arg_B

Because	O
the	O

up,	O
they	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
enough	Arg_I
ability	Arg_I

understand	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
with	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

However,	O
some	Arg_B
lecturers	Arg_I

very	Arg_I
informative	Arg_I

interesting	Arg_I
way	Arg_I

When	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
obviously	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
it	Arg_I

very	Arg_I
useful	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
did	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
waste	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

Additionally,	O

some	Arg_B

When	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

out	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

However,	O
from	O
my	O

students	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
acquire	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
prerequisite	Arg_I

passing	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
reasons	O
to	O
be	O
illustrated	O
are	O
follows	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
the	Arg_B
students	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
constantly	Arg_I
expert	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
subject	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
I	O
love	O
Physics	O
.	O
But	O
I	O
don't	O
like	O
electronics,	O
because	O
electronics	Arg_B
cannot	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
seen	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
real	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
.	O
And	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
0	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
physics	Arg_I
score	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
electronics	Arg_I
.	O
But	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
constantly	Arg_I
achieve	Arg_I
100	Arg_I
score	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
physics	Arg_I
.	O
And	Arg_B
if	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
until	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
pass	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
electronics,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
pass	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
entire	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
physics,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
fail	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I
over	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
over	Arg_I
again	Arg_I
.	O
Luckily,	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
university,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
regardless	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
score	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
reach	Arg_I
.	O
And	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
physics	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
consideration	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
electronics	Arg_I
.	O
And	Arg_B
at	Arg_I
last,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
took	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
electronics	Arg_I
again	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
pass	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
if	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
policy	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
passing	Arg_I
exam,	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
highly	Arg_I
likely	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
leave	Arg_I
uncultivated	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
one	Arg_I
fail	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
exam,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
she	Arg_I
cannot	Arg_I
participate	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
.	O
And	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
nothing	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
campus	Arg_I
.	O
Then	O
he	Arg_B
or	Arg_I
she	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
play	Arg_I
online	Arg_I
games	Arg_I
days	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
nights	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
academic	Arg_I
achievement	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
decline	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
the	O
end,	O
this	Arg_B
student	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
loser	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
.	O
And	Arg_B
all	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
due	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
permit	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
failure	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
entire	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
system	Arg_I
.	O
Admittedly,	O
the	Arg_B
university	Arg_I
student	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
reach	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
allow	Arg_I
student	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
participate	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
matter	Arg_I
whether	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
pass	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
test	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
.	O
But	O
the	Arg_B
benefit	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
free	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
access	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
eclipse	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
issue	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
lower	Arg_I
points	Arg_I
.	O
All	O
in	O
all,	O
the	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

to	Arg_I
participate	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
classed	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
passing	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

every	Arg_I

every	Arg_I
part	Arg_I

one	Arg_I

Money	Arg_B

facilities	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
update	Arg_I
resources,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
beneficial	Arg_I

rather	Arg_I

The	O
following	O
are	O
my	O
opinions	O
.	O
To	O
begin	O
with,	O
the	Arg_B
school	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
put	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
emphasis	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
instead	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
professors	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
think	O
the	Arg_B
most	Arg_I
efficient	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
guide	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
actively	Arg_I
.	O
By	Arg_B
renewing	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
facilities	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
assignment	Arg_I
.	O
A	Arg_B
comfortable	Arg_I
environment	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
attract	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
stay	Arg_I
longer	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
students	Arg_B
spend	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
circulation	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
.	O
That	O
is	O
to	O
say,	O
students	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
environment	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
assignments	Arg_I
so	O
the	Arg_B
quality	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
assignments	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
the	Arg_B
competition	Arg_I
between	Arg_I
peers	Arg_I
enhances	Arg_I

forms	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
circulation	Arg_I

In	Arg_B
my	Arg_I
school,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
classrooms	Arg_I

my	Arg_I
university	Arg_I

old	Arg_I

kind	Arg_I

shabby	Arg_I

For	O
me,	O
I	Arg_B
prefer	Arg_I
spending	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
coffee	Arg_I
shop	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
staying	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
school	Arg_I

finish	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
assignment	Arg_I

It's	Arg_B
unpleasant	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
stay	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
coffee	Arg_B
shops	Arg_I

my	Arg_I

often	Arg_I
finish	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
roughly	Arg_I

Besides,	O
the	Arg_B

We	Arg_B

some	Arg_I

will	Arg_I
ever	Arg_I
do	Arg_I

To	O

When	Arg_B
I	Arg_I

14	Arg_I

my	Arg_I

no	Arg_I

important	Arg_I

Talking	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
my	Arg_I

was	Arg_I
frustrating	Arg_I
because	O
none	Arg_B

them	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
way	Arg_I

Since	O

all	O
alone	O
at	O
home	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time,	O
my	Arg_B
dog	Arg_I
was	Arg_I

me	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
him	Arg_I

understand	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
deeply	Arg_I
feelings	Arg_I

Clearly,	O
although	O
pets	O

speak	O
with	O
us,	O
we	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
nonetheless	Arg_I
count	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
them	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
pets	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
useful	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
variety	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
nowadays	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
pet	Arg_I
therapy	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
becoming	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
popular	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
before	Arg_I

Researchers	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
discovered	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
pets	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
bring	Arg_I
benefits	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
huge	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
of	Arg_I

There	Arg_B

dogs	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
lead	Arg_I
blind	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
around	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

therefore	O
without	Arg_B

not	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
around	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
alone	Arg_I

In	O
addition,	O
pets	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
depressed	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
because	O
their	Arg_B
presence	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
better	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
there	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
dogs	Arg_I

are	Arg_I
educated	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

To	O
sum	O
up,	O
I	O

that	O
pets	Arg_B

the	O

My	O

the	O

that	O
Every	O

those	Arg_B

them	Arg_I

For	O

when	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
tried	Arg_I

walking,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
stumble	Arg_I

hurt	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
many	Arg_I

But	O
they	Arg_B
slowly	Arg_I

their	Arg_I

walk	Arg_I

All	Arg_B

So,	O
all	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

Hence,	O
thanks	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
information	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
provided;	Arg_I
now	Arg_I
she	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
confidence	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
parents	Arg_B
always	Arg_I
tell	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
tenser	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
because	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
experience	O
it,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
difficult	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
really	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
tense	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
we	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
part-time	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
teach	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
real	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
.	O
Actually,	O
some	Arg_B
questionnaires	Arg_I
indicate	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
taken	Arg_I
part-time	Arg_I
jobs,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
importantly;	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
expect	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
taken	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
part-time	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
the	Arg_B
part-time	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
.	O
Third,	O
some	O
parents	O
are	O
afraid	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
part-time	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
effect	Arg_I
student'	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
.	O
Actually,	O
most	O
students	O
will	O
do	O
the	O
part-time	O
job	O
in	O
their	O
holiday,	O
so	O
it	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
effect	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
.	O
Compared	Arg_B
with	Arg_I
playing	Arg_I
computers	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
day,	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
part-time	Arg_I
jobs	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
choice	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
holiday	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
taking	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
part-time	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
let	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
experience	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
real	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
parents	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
encourage	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
part-time	Arg_I
job	Arg_I

Being	Arg_B

nature	Arg_I
introvert,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
have	Arg_I

Once,	Arg_B

our	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

.	O
I	O
whole-heartedly	O
agree	O
with	O
this	O
opinion	O
because	O
of	O
these	O
following	O
reasons	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
parents	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
early	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
As	Arg_B
we	Arg_I
were	Arg_I
born,	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
taught	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
little	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
smile,	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
walk	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
ordinary	Arg_I
routines	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
eating	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
when	Arg_B
we	Arg_I
grow	Arg_I
bigger,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
teach	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
fairy	Arg_I
tales	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
ethic	Arg_I
lessons	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
affect	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
till	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
end	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
at	Arg_B
school	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
bigger	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
sciences	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
languages,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
we	Arg_B
spend	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
families	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
think	O
when	O
we	O
leave	O
school,	O
maybe	O
we	O
will	O
forget	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
lessons	O
we	O
learn	O
at	O
school	O
if	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
experience	O
them	O
in	O
life,	O
but	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
we	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
never	Arg_I
forget	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
taught	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
because	O
we	Arg_B
use	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
I	Arg_B
believe	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
never	Arg_I
forget	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
told	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
grateful	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
.	O
Thirdly,	O
I	O
totally	O
believe	O
parents	Arg_B
love	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
sons	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
daughters	Arg_I
unconditionally	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
even	Arg_B
when	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
grow	Arg_I
older,	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
married	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
families	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
spouses	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
children,	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
watching	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
realize	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
wrong	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
my	Arg_B
older	Arg_I
brother	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
got	Arg_I
married	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
lived	Arg_I
independently	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
two	Arg_I
years	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
faces	Arg_I
difficulties	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
life,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
comes	Arg_I
back	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
meet	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
ask	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
advice	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
parents	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I

at	O

the	O
reasons	O

I	O
agree	O
that	O
people	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
sometimes	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
enjoy	Arg_I
doing	O
will	O
be	O
explored	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
most	Arg_B
people's	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
filled	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
tasks	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
enjoy	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
.In	O
personal	O
live,	O
we	O
have	O
some	O
responsibilities	O
towards	O
to	O
other	O
people,	O
there	O
is	O
nobody	O
who	O
likes	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
responsibilities	O
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
housework	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
difficult	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
me,	Arg_I
although	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
husband	Arg_I
helps	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
them,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
responsibility	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
really	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
them,	Arg_I
however	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,professional	O
lives	O
are	O
filled	O
with	O
tasks	O
that	O
is	O
neccessary	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
jobs	O
.	O
Nobody	Arg_B
likes	Arg_I
attending	Arg_I
boring	Arg_I
conferences,	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
isn't	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
anyone	Arg_I
.	O
I'm	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
research	Arg_I
asistant	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
university,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
univesity	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
ours	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
professor	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
isn't	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
human	Arg_I
relationships,	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
asistans	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
enjoy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
talk	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
situation,	Arg_I
although	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
ask	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
field	Arg_I
.	O
Thirdly,	O
doing	Arg_B
something	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
individual	Arg_I
doesn't	Arg_I
enjoy	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
led	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
enjoyment	Arg_I
.	O
People	Arg_B
sometimes	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
attend	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
insisting	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
although	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
really	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
one	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
tell	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
husband	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
dance	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
both	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
.	O
After	Arg_B
insisting	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
friends,	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
attended,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
got	Arg_I
really	Arg_I
enjoyable	Arg_I
time,	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
continued	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
six	Arg_I
months	Arg_I
although	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
left	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
month	Arg_I
.	O
Nobody	O
has	O
a	O
life	O
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
fun;	O
there	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
sometimes	Arg_I
unpleasant	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
boring	Arg_I
parts	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
liked	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
anyone,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
responsibilities	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
individual's	Arg_I
live	Arg_I

Young	O

on	O
how	O
long	O
they	O

their	O

As	O

they	O

to	O

more	O
freedom	O

want	O
to	O

on	O
their	O

But,	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
what	O
is	O
the	O
right	O
age	O
for	O
young	O
adults	O
to	O
leave	O
their	O
parents	O
and	O
start	O
living	O
on	O
their	O
own	O
is	O
a	O
contentious	O
one	O
.	O
Personally,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
young	Arg_B
adults	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
live	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
longer	Arg_I
period	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
.	O
Living	Arg_B
on	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
huge	Arg_I
financial	Arg_I
commitment	Arg_I
.	O
At	O
younger	O
age	O
people	O
are	O
less	O
likely	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
high	O
paying	O
job,	O
so	O
It	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
difficult	Arg_I
task	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
pay	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
rent,	Arg_I
food,	Arg_I
utilities	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
expenses	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
sustain	Arg_I
yourself	Arg_I
.	O
So,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
living	Arg_B
with	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
wise	Arg_I
choice	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
adults	Arg_I
until	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
head	Arg_I
start	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
professional	Arg_I
career	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
reasonable	Arg_I
income	Arg_I
.	O
Another	Arg_B
advantage	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
longer	Arg_I
period	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
enhanced	Arg_I
emotional	Arg_I
attachment	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
Parents	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
advice	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
through	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
changes	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
Living	Arg_B
together	Arg_I
develops	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
environment	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
discussing	Arg_I
adult's	Arg_I
physiological	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
psychological	Arg_I
changes	Arg_I
face	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
face	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
.	O
Young	Arg_B
adults	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
reluctant	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
discuss	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
move	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
live	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
thus	Arg_I
missing	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
input	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
.	O
While	O
some	O
critics	O
may	O
argue	O
that,	O
young	Arg_B
adults	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
free	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
most	Arg_B
young	Arg_I
adults	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
inclined	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
unprecedented	Arg_I
advantages	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
freedom	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
thing	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
does	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
freedom	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
party	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
night,	Arg_I
smoke	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
drugs	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
a	O
nutshell,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
young	Arg_B
adults	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
consider	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
sure	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
sustain	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
unwise	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
trade	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
opportunity	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
longer	Arg_I
period	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
late	Arg_I
night	Arg_I
parties	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
drugs	Arg_I

Thus,	O
to	Arg_B
cope	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
physiological	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
psychological	Arg_I
changes	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
life,	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
financial	Arg_I
life	Arg_I

less	Arg_I
struggle	Arg_I

to	Arg_I
prevent	Arg_I

theirs	Arg_I
buddies	Arg_I
such	Arg_I

Twitter	Arg_I

also	Arg_I
make	Arg_I

Another	O
perspective,	O
using	Arg_B

these	Arg_I

It	O

The	O
consequence	O

this	O

some	Arg_B

However,	O

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
admittedly	O

strongly	O
agree	O
that	O
the	Arg_B

Besides,	O

People	O

a	O

a	O

at	O
a	O

the	O

Some	O

Competitive	Arg_B
children	Arg_I
are	Arg_I

to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
confident	Arg_I
enough	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
handle	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
situations	Arg_I
independently	Arg_I

This	O
factor	O
initially	O
arises	O
from	O
the	O
school,	O
where	O
teacher	O
encourages	O
student	O
to	O
feel	O
more	O

through	O

this	O

This	O

their	O

but	O
will	O
also	O
restrict	O
them	O
in	O
many	O
ways	O

For	O
example,	O
MNCs	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
mainly	Arg_I
focusing	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
team	Arg_I
work,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
competitive	Arg_I

would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
having	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

in	Arg_I
managing	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
team	Arg_I

However,	O
those	Arg_B
who	Arg_I

create	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
sense	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
co-operation	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

Although,	O
they	O

not	O
be	O
having	O
a	O

and	O
an	O
eager	O
to	O
get	O
on	O
the	O

as	O
the	O
competitors	O

they	Arg_B

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
though	O
competitive	O
children	O
will	O
be	O

more	O
clever	O
and	O
faster	O
than	O
the	O

on	O
the	O

co-operative	Arg_B

To	O

that	O

Instead	Arg_B

a	Arg_B

First	O

all,	O

the	O
fact	O
that	O
people;	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
prefer	Arg_I

their	Arg_I
health	Arg_I

By	Arg_B
working	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
long,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
often	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
tired,	Arg_I
lazy	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
reluctant	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
carry	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
physical	Arg_I
exercise	Arg_I

eventually	Arg_I
loose	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
they	Arg_B
become	Arg_I

become	Arg_I
workaholic	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
repercussion	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

off	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
end	Arg_I
up	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
these	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

they	Arg_B

many	Arg_I
years	Arg_I

Recently,	Arg_B
his	Arg_I
health	Arg_I

personal	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
drastically	Arg_I

he	Arg_I
broke	Arg_I
up	Arg_I

his	Arg_I

his	Arg_I

totally	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

cries	Arg_I

He	Arg_B
started	Arg_I
regretting	Arg_I
afterwards	Arg_I

now	Arg_I
trying	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
manage	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
seems	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I

him	Arg_I

To	O
conclude	O
this,	O
I	Arg_B
would	Arg_I
strongly	Arg_I

I	Arg_B
disagree	Arg_I

such	Arg_I

should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
got	Arg_I
rid	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

Many	O
people	O
believe	O
that	O
students	Arg_B
only	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I
subjects	Arg_I
like	Arg_I

because	O
these	Arg_B
subject	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
necessary	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
students'	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
.	O
This	O
is	O
understandable	O
when	Arg_B
labor	Arg_I
market	Arg_I
now	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
high	Arg_I
competition;	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
meet	Arg_I
requirements	Arg_I

of	Arg_I
qualification	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
the	O
unemployment	O

their	O
parents	Arg_B

these	Arg_I

can	Arg_I
help	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
job	Arg_I

Although	O
those	O
above	O
reasons	O

acceptable,	O
I	O
would	O
argue	O
that	O
there	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
having	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
.	O
Firstly,	O
studying	Arg_B
music,	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
sports	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
enables	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
develop	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
potentials	Arg_I
through	Arg_I
discovering	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
natural	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
around	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
to	Arg_B
get	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
labor	Arg_I
market,	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
require	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
soft	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
such	Arg_I

teamwork,	Arg_I
presentation	Arg_I

For	O

through	Arg_B
taking	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
sport,	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
team	Arg_I
spirit	Arg_I

learn	Arg_I
lessons	Arg_I
about	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
these	Arg_B

might	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

Finally,	O
children's	Arg_B

do	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

If	Arg_B
they	Arg_I

Consequently,	O
the	Arg_B
attention	Arg_I

This	O

Nevertheless,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
other	Arg_B

do	Arg_I
set	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
role	Arg_I
models	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
visible	Arg_I
accomplishments	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
celebrities	Arg_B
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
sports	Arg_I
player	Arg_I
whose	Arg_I
performance	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
professional	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
directly	Arg_I
seen	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
fans	Arg_I
.	O
This	O
means	O
that	O
people	Arg_B
understand	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
deal	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
efforts	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
training	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
directly	Arg_I
linked	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
results	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
this	Arg_B
kind	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
self-made	Arg_I
celebrity	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
inspire	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
develop	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
talents	Arg_I
through	Arg_I

perseverance	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
other	Arg_B

such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I

also	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
achieved	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
success	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
career	Arg_I

Take	Arg_B
Michael	Arg_I

an	Arg_I

his	Arg_I

around	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

been	Arg_I
extremely	Arg_I
welcomed	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
younger	Arg_I
generation	Arg_I

His	Arg_B
songs	Arg_I
spread	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
idea	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
care	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
each	Arg_I

By	Arg_B

watching	Arg_B

Sometimes,	Arg_B
students	Arg_I
watch	Arg_I
restrictive	Arg_I

believe	O
demerits	Arg_B

old	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

The	Arg_B

The	Arg_B
misery	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
refuse	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
existence	Arg_I

modernity	Arg_I

most	Arg_B

Secondly,	O
their	Arg_B
unresponsiveness	Arg_I

the	Arg_B

For	O

in	Arg_B

it	O

smoking	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
early	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
in	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
survey	Arg_I
carried	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
university,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
asked	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
why	Arg_I
did	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
start	Arg_I
smoking,	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
around	Arg_I
forty	Arg_I
percent	Arg_I

individuals	Arg_I
answered	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
wanted	Arg_I

favorite	Arg_I
screen	Arg_I
actor	Arg_I
while	Arg_I
smoking	Arg_I
cigarettes	Arg_I

This	O
example	O
makes	O
it	O
clear	O
that	O
imitating	Arg_B

a	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I
influence	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
individuals	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
it	O
is	O
believed	O
that	O
when	Arg_B
youth	Arg_I
follows	Arg_I

it	Arg_I
affects	Arg_I

only	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
attire	Arg_I

their	Arg_I
favorite	Arg_I

but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
behavior	Arg_I

For	O
instance	O
recently	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
poll	Arg_I
conducted	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
American	Arg_I
magazine	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
found	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I

complain	Arg_I
that	Arg_I

abusive	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I

So,	O
this	O
example	O
makes	O
it	O
obvious	O
that	O
these	Arg_B

have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
poor	Arg_I
effect	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

of	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
people	Arg_I

Thus	O
to	O
conclude,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
when	Arg_B
young	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
follow	Arg_I
celebrities,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
affects	Arg_I

Therefore	O
it	O

The	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I
life	Arg_I

We	O
can	O
see	O
now	O
that	O
women	Arg_B
tend	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
various	Arg_I
fields	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
past	Arg_I
normally	Arg_I
done	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
men	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I

engineers,	Arg_I

Those	O
activities	O
have	O
proven	O
that	O
women	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
men's	Arg_I
works	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
female	Arg_B
students	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
indicated	Arg_I
having	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

potential	Arg_I

men	Arg_I

Another	O
reason	O

These	Arg_B

when	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
not	Arg_I

So,	O
learning	Arg_B
from	Arg_I
human's	Arg_I

provides	Arg_I
someone	Arg_I

The	O
question	O
whether	O

make	O
an	O
effort	O
to	O
preserve	O
them	O
by	O

that	O
minority	O

or	O
not	O
is	O
still	O
a	O
debatable	O
one	O
.	O
I	O
personally	O
suppose	O
that	O
no	Arg_B
matter	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
widely	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
spoken,	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
protected	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
disappeared	Arg_I
.	O
There	O
are	O
several	O
reasons	O
why	O
saving	Arg_B
regional	Arg_I
languages	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
seen	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
waste	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
.	O
Firstly,	O
we	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
consider	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
expands	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
scope	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
languages,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
really	Arg_I
expensive	Arg_I
because	O
educational	Arg_B
programmes	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
given	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
using	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
some	O
certain	O
areas	O
in	O
the	O
Southern	O
Vietnam	O
have	O
been	O
trying	O
to	O
help	O
their	O
secondary	O
school	O
students	O
who	O
are	O
originally	O
from	O
khmer	O
people	O
speak	O
their	O
language	O
beside	O
Vietnamese,	O
so	O
the	Arg_B
local	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
recently	Arg_I
struggled	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
costly	Arg_I
investments	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
teachers,	Arg_I
facilities	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
appropriate	Arg_I
materials	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
it	O
is	O
obvious	O
that	O
in	Arg_B
many	Arg_I
aspects	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
communication,	Arg_I
trade,	Arg_I
cooperation	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
transaction,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
absolutely	Arg_I
easier	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
whole	Arg_I
society	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
together	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
.	O
Despite	O
of	O
the	O
above	O
arguments,	O
i	O
still	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
government	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
try	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
preserve	Arg_I
minority	Arg_I
languages	Arg_I
.	O
This	O
is	O
because	O
language	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
seen	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
method	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
communication	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
forming	O
a	O
language	O
must	O
be	O
undergone	O
thousands	O
of	O
years;	O
thus,	O
it	Arg_B
deserves	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
respected	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
preserved	Arg_I
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
language	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I
factors	Arg_I
creating	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
differences	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
unique	Arg_I
cutures	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
saving	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
kinds	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
languages	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
case	Arg_I
generally	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
element	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I
diversity's	Arg_I
preservation	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
although	O
letting	O
languages	O
spoken	O
by	O
ethnic	O
minorities	O
be	O
extinct	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
very	O

that	O
if	Arg_B

Taxation	Arg_B
may	Arg_I

However,	O
taxation	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

some	O

reasons	O

be	O
given	O

the	O
following	O
paragraphs	O

First	O
of	O
all,	O
we	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
consider	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
police	Arg_I
armed	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
guns	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
kinds	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
legal	Arg_I
weapons	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
attempts	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
protect	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
civilians	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
himself	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
criminals	Arg_B
todays	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
sophisticated	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
spend	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
large	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
acquire	Arg_I
modern	Arg_I
weapons	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
cope	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
police	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
serve	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
nefarious	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
citizens	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
society	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
shot	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
both	Arg_I
police	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
offenders	Arg_I
accidentally	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
while	Arg_B
on	Arg_I
duty,	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
private	Arg_I
citizens	Arg_I
affected	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
facilities	Arg_I
such	Arg_I

streets	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
likely	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
destroyed	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
guns	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
a	Arg_B
society	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
police	Arg_I
force	Arg_I
carries	Arg_I
guns	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
definitely	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
highly	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
police	Arg_B
force	Arg_I
carries	Arg_I
guns	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
high	Arg_I

Hence,	O
people	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
police	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
ones	Arg_I
usually	Arg_I

Reducing	O

the	O
widely	O
accepted	O
solution	O

by	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
governments	O

the	O
world	O
today	O

Personally,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
governments	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
definitely	Arg_I
reduce	Arg_I
violent	Arg_I
components	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
minimum	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
kidvids,	Arg_I
while	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
contents	Arg_I
remain	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
TV	Arg_I
shows	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
mature	Arg_I
minds	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
watch	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
entirely	Arg_I
reasonable	Arg_I
.	O
Admittedly,	O
reducing	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
proportion	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
violent	Arg_I
content	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
TV	Arg_I
shows	Arg_I
could,	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
degree,	Arg_I
decrease	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
overall	Arg_I
crime	Arg_I
rate	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
tackle	O
this	O
problem	O
more	O
effectively,	O
governments	Arg_B
must	Arg_I
first	Arg_I
prohibit	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
types	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
violent	Arg_I
content	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
children’s	Arg_I
television	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
.	O
As	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
result	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
mental	Arg_I
immaturity,	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
youngsters	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
incapable	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
distinguishing	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
wrong	Arg_I
.	O
Little	O
wonder,	O
then,	O
that	O
by	Arg_B
watching	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
violent	Arg_I
TV	Arg_I
programs	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
videos,	Arg_I
juveniles	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
aggressive	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
offensive	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
tendency	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
commit	Arg_I
crimes	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
it	Arg_B
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
rather	Arg_I
necessary	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
governments	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
establish	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
intensive	Arg_I
law	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
prevents	Arg_I
teenagers	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
watching	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
violent	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
brutal	Arg_I
TV	Arg_I
Shows	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
.	O
Nevertheless,	O
it	Arg_B
would	Arg_I
certainly	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
violation	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
adults’	Arg_I
civil	Arg_I
liberties,	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
governments	Arg_I
implement	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
restricted	Arg_I
regulation	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
TV	Arg_I
shows	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
mature	Arg_I
audiences	Arg_I
.	O
Frequently,	O
adults	Arg_B
watch	Arg_I
horror	Arg_I
video	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
war	Arg_I
movies	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
relaxing	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
busy	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
.	O
For	Arg_B
whom,	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
media	Arg_I
sources	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
mere	Arg_I
materials	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
relaxation	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
entertainment	Arg_I
.	O
Considering	Arg_B
that	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
mature	Arg_I
minds	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
capable	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
responsible	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
behaviors,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
certainly	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
watch	Arg_I

shows	Arg_I

that	Arg_I

them	Arg_I

In	O

it	O

my	O

On	O

agree	O
that	O
a	Arg_B

An	Arg_B
obvious	Arg_I
example	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
happens	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
The	Arg_I
United	Arg_I
State,	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
man	Arg_I
killed	Arg_I

ten	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
cinema	Arg_I
using	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
police	Arg_I
shot	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
foot	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
paralyze	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
.	O
Obviously,	O
police	O
officers	O
can	O
force	O
a	O
criminal	O
to	O
surrender,	O
because	O
they	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
weapon	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
prevent	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
escaping	Arg_I
criminal	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
poses	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
serious	Arg_I
danger	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
some	Arg_B
military	Arg_I
weapons	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
encouraging	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
police	Arg_I
officers	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
protect	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
there	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
reason	Arg_I
why	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
level	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
bloody	Arg_I
increases	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
communities	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
the	Arg_B
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
unemployment	Arg_I
rate	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
risen	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
15	Arg_I
percent	Arg_I

some	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
cost	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
big	Arg_I
city	Arg_I

this	Arg_I

impresses	Arg_I
some	Arg_I

me	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
guns	Arg_I

that	O

it	Arg_B

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O

In	O
fact,	O
stringent	Arg_B
gun	Arg_I

not	Arg_I
decrease	Arg_I
violence	Arg_I

For	O

Furthermore,	O
the	Arg_B

The	O
reason	O
is	O
that,	O
as	Arg_B
most	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
telecommunication	Arg_I
companies	Arg_I
provide	Arg_I

with	Arg_I
access	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

have	Arg_I
shortened	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

sum	O
up,	O
although	O

it	Arg_B

However,	O
I	O

convinced	O
that	O
these	Arg_B

absolutely	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
by	Arg_B

public	Arg_I
school,	Arg_I
affluent	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
effectively	Arg_I
contribute	Arg_I

narrowing	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
gap	Arg_I

It	O
is	O
true	O
that	O

attend	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

With	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
tax	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
pay,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
rich	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
vast	Arg_I
number	Arg_I

students	Arg_I

earn	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
quality	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
the	Arg_B
tax	Arg_I
reduction	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
private	Arg_I

would	Arg_I
lead	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
waste	Arg_I

Obviously,	O
this	O
reduction	O
would	O
cause	O
a	O
difficulty	O

the	O

the	Arg_B

this	Arg_I
sophisticated	Arg_I

In	O

the	Arg_B
government	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
pay	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
salary	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
excessive	Arg_I
officials,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
result	Arg_I

insufficient	Arg_I

other	Arg_I
crucial	Arg_I
public	Arg_I

Many	O

for	O
the	O

claim	O
that	O
such	Arg_B
tax	Arg_I

are	Arg_I
unfair	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
them	Arg_I

They	O
point	O
out	O
that	O
it	Arg_B

irrational	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
require	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
pay	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
taxes	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
use	Arg_I

Nevertheless,	O
we	Arg_B
also	Arg_I
pay	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
public	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
do	Arg_I

We	Arg_B
certainly	Arg_I

On	O
the	O

that	O

both	Arg_B

The	Arg_B

a	Arg_I
greater	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

decreasing	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

the	Arg_B

In	O

there	Arg_B
