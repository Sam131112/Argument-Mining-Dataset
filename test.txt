International	O
tourism	O
is	O
now	O
more	O
common	O
than	O
ever	O
before	O
The	O
last	O
50	O
years	O
have	O
seen	O
a	O
significant	O
increase	O
in	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
tourist	O
traveling	O
worldwide	O
.	O
While	O
some	O
might	O
think	O
the	B-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
profit	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
destination	I-ARG
countries,	I-ARG
I	O
would	O
contend	O
that	O
this	B-ARG
industry	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
affected	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
attributes	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
damaged	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tourist	I-ARG
destinations	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
undeniable	O
fact	O
that	O
tourists	B-ARG
from	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
probably	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
changes	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
identity	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tourist	I-ARG
destinations	I-ARG
.	O
Take	B-ARG
Thailand	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
example,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Vietnam	I-ARG
War,	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
American	I-ARG
soldiers	I-ARG
came	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
Thailand	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
break	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
involved	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
sexual	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
drug	I-ARG
activities,	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG
demands	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
businesses	I-ARG
opened	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
expanded,	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
illegally	I-ARG
involved	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
under-age	I-ARG
prostitutes	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
maximize	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
profits	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
was	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lack	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
adequate	I-ARG
controls	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
authorities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
image	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
Thailand	I-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore	O
this	O
proves	O
that	O
international	B-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
impacts	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
destination	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
there	O
are	O
clear	O
evidences	O
that	O
tourism	B-ARG
increasingly	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
harms	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
habitats	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
destination	I-ARG
appeals	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
Australia’s	I-ARG
Great	I-ARG
Barrier	I-ARG
Reef	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
shown,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
billion	I-ARG
visitors	I-ARG
per	I-ARG
annum	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
generated	I-ARG
immense	I-ARG
destruction	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
nature	I-ARG
wonder,	I-ARG
namely	I-ARG
breaking	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
corals	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
walking	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
throwing	I-ARG
boat’s	I-ARG
anchors,	I-ARG
dropping	I-ARG
fuel	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
sorts	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
pollutions	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
this	O
reason,	O
many	B-ARG
marine	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
endangered,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
extremes	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
reef	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
uninhabitable	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
marine	I-ARG
species	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
it	O
is	O
apparent	O
that	O
tourism	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
threatened	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
nature	I-ARG
environments	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
created	I-ARG
threatening	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
sociocultural	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
natural	I-ARG
environments	I-ARG
.	O
If	O
authorities	O
do	O
not	O
take	O
steps	O
to	O
appropriately	O
conserve	O
these	O
precious	O
values,	O
they	O
will	O
be	O
destroyed	O
in	O
the	O
near	O
future	O

Living	O
and	O
studying	O
overseas	O
It	O
is	O
every	O
student's	O
desire	O
to	O
study	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
university	O
and	O
experience	O
a	O
new	O
environment	O
.	O
While	O
some	O
students	O
study	O
and	O
live	O
overseas	O
to	O
achieve	O
this,	O
some	O
prefer	O
to	O
study	O
home	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
difficulties	O
of	O
living	O
and	O
studying	O
overseas	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
one	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG
overseas	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
gain	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
throughout	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
First,	O
studying	B-ARG
at	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
overseas	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
gives	I-ARG
individuals	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
opportunity	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
interacting	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
communicating	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
origins	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG
.	O
Compared	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
peers	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
country,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
overseas	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
successful	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
adapting	I-ARG
himself/herself	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
environments	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
situations	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
living	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
overseas	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
irreplaceable	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
comes	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
standing	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
feet	I-ARG
.	O
One	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
overseas	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
struggle	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
loneliness,	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
but	O
those	B-ARG
difficulties	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
turn	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
following	I-ARG
steps	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
the	B-ARG
one	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
depending	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
anyone	I-ARG
else	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
employers	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
mostly	I-ARG
looking	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
.	O
Becoming	B-ARG
successful	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
edge	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
market	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
one	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
studied	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
lived	I-ARG
overseas	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
eligible	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
his/her	I-ARG
peers	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
there	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
difficulties	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
overseas	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
living	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
overseas	I-ARG
gives	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
individual	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
perspective	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
subject	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
studied	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
general	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O

very	O

thing	O
that	O
students	O
do,	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
different	O
reasons	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
studying	B-ARG
abroad	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
.	O
Students	B-ARG
gain	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

out	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
personally,	I-ARG
academically,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
culturally	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
students	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
outside	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
Living	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
requires	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
flexibility	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
adaptability	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
one's	I-ARG
character	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
students	B-ARG
might	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
challenges	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
host	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
they	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
obstacles	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
encounter	I-ARG

Overcoming	B-ARG
problems	I-ARG
teaches	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
mature	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
self-independence	I-ARG
.	O
One	O
other	O
important	O
factor	O
is	O
the	B-ARG
new	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
obtain	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
institution	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
pursuing	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
studies	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
they	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
exposed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
educational	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
classmates	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
Most	B-ARG
important	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
aspect	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
.	O
While	B-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
country,	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
country	I-ARG

They	B-ARG

their	I-ARG
customs	I-ARG
and	I-ARG

and	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG

Learning	B-ARG
about	I-ARG
others'	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
important	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
contributes	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
building	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
understanding	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
how	I-ARG

First,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
unfair	I-ARG

the	B-ARG
most	I-ARG

method	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

for	I-ARG

The	B-ARG

When	B-ARG

the	I-ARG

of	O

such	O
as	O
newspapers,	O

it	O

Many	O
believe	O
that	O

it	O
should	O

a	O
complete	O

idea	O

Both	O

before	O
a	O
reasonable	O
conclusion	O
is	O
drawn	O
.	O
First,	O
it	O
is	O
generally	O
understood	O
that	O
advertising	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
carried	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
purpose	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
promoting	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
services	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
encouraging	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
consume	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
.	O
Advertisements	B-ARG
are,	I-ARG
therefore,	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
businesses	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
sales	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
hence	I-ARG
profits	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
to	B-ARG
consumers,	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
customers	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
telecommunication	I-ARG
services	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
current	I-ARG
offers	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
and	O
hence	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
compare	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
decision	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
choosing	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
internet	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
mobile	I-ARG
phone	I-ARG
plans	I-ARG
.	O
From	O
all	O
of	O
these,	O
it	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
see	O
why	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
advertising	O
is	O
a	O
positive	O
part	O
of	O
life	O
will	O
garner	O
strong	O
support	O
.	O
However,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
seen	O
that	O
some	O
people	O
have	O
argued	O
against	O
advertising	O
due	O
to	O
its	O
negative	O
impacts	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
a	B-ARG
huge	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
advertisements	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
sent	I-ARG
automatically	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
phones	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
email	I-ARG
addresses,	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
generally	I-ARG
known	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
spam,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
causes	I-ARG
discomfort	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
annoyance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
advertising	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
expensive	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
campaign	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
done	I-ARG
successfully	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
brings	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
results	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
advertising	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
believed	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
many,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
burden	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
businesses	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
after	O
analyzing	O
the	O
pros	O
and	O
cons	O
of	O
advertising,	O
both	O
of	O
the	O
views	O
have	O
strong	O
support,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
felt	O
that	O
more	B-ARG
good	I-ARG
comes	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
bad	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
the	B-ARG
idea	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
positive	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
supported	I-ARG
.	O

It	O
is	O
better	O
for	O
children	O
to	O
grow	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
countryside	O
than	O
in	O
a	O
big	O
city?	O
Nowadays	O
living	O
is	O
possible	O
on	O
every	O
place	O
of	O
the	O
world,	O
but	O
still	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
differences	O
among	O
them	O
.	O
From	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
big	B-ARG
cities	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
bringing	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
begin	O
with,	O
it	O
is	O
undeniable	O
that	O
education	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
parts	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
children's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
past	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
earlier	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG

What	O
is	O
more,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
acknowledged	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
creational	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
built	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG

Children	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
entertainment	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example	O
playgrounds,	B-ARG
parks,	I-ARG
science	I-ARG
museums,	I-ARG
cinemas	I-ARG
etc	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
in	B-ARG
countrysides	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
hardly	I-ARG
ever	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
creational	I-ARG
facilities	I-ARG

Children	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
countrysides	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
pass	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

.	O
Finally,	O
in	B-ARG
big	I-ARG
cities	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
access	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
media	I-ARG
easily,	I-ARG
so	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
watching	I-ARG
television	I-ARG

surfing	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

Via	B-ARG
internet	I-ARG
they	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
connection	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world,	I-ARG
therefor	O
they	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
exchange	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
knowledge,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
although	O
countrysides	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
fresh	I-ARG
air,	I-ARG
peace,	I-ARG

Today's	B-ARG
children	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
somethings	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
entertain	I-ARG
them,	I-ARG

A	O

not?	O
The	O
21st	O

witnessed	O
the	O

From	O
my	O
perspective,	O
a	B-ARG
universal	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
dominant	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
community	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
vital	I-ARG
significance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
global	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
especially	O
true	O
if	O
we	O
consider	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
a	B-ARG
single	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
plays	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
pivotal	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
global	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
cooperation	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
businessmen	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
access	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
language,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
communicate	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
efficiently	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
deeply	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
trade,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
intensify	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
transnational	I-ARG
cooperation	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
contrast,	O
without	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
availability	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
language,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
misunderstanding	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
conflicts	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
ensue	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
negotiations,	I-ARG
impeding	I-ARG
collaborations	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
a	B-ARG
single	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
serves	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
economic	I-ARG
purpose	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
a	B-ARG
universal	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
integral	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
interactions	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
equipped	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
single	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
language,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
tell	I-ARG
each	I-ARG

smoothly	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
countries'	I-ARG

as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

For	O

travel	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
countries,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
people	I-ARG

introduce	I-ARG

such	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
command	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
universal	I-ARG

helping	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
visitors	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
enjoyable	I-ARG
exotic	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
.	O
In	O

of	O
this,	O
the	O
disadvantages	O
of	O
the	O
promotion	O
of	O
a	O
universal	O

cannot	O
be	O
denied	O
.	O
To	O
be	O
more	O
specific,	O
a	B-ARG
single	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
may,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
extent,	I-ARG
erode	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
identity	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
nation	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
because	O
people	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
impressed	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cultural	I-ARG
values	I-ARG
brought	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
universal	I-ARG
language,	I-ARG
eroding	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sense	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
national	I-ARG
belong	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
some	B-ARG
Asians	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
seeking	I-ARG
individualism,	I-ARG
previously	I-ARG
denied	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
Asian	I-ARG
countries,	I-ARG
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
gradually	I-ARG
identified	I-ARG

such	I-ARG

American	I-ARG
movies,	I-ARG

result	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
I	O
would	O
conclude	O
that	O
a	B-ARG

contributes	I-ARG

sports	B-ARG

Because	O
a	B-ARG

Consequently,	O

with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
spirit	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
healthiness,	I-ARG

After	B-ARG

moments	I-ARG
in	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
competitors	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
shake	I-ARG
hands	I-ARG
friendly	I-ARG

congratulate	I-ARG

both	I-ARG

Seeing	B-ARG

the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
emotional	I-ARG

The	B-ARG

his	I-ARG

When	B-ARG

For	O

when	B-ARG

the	I-ARG
champion	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
SEAGAMES	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
first	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
2008,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
festival	I-ARG
atmosphere	I-ARG
permeated	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

People	B-ARG
from	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
ages	I-ARG
turned	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
streets	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
flags,	I-ARG
banners	I-ARG

they	I-ARG
sang	I-ARG
aloud	I-ARG

President	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
eager	I-ARG
atmosphere	I-ARG
lasted	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
next	I-ARG
days	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
fact,	O
some	B-ARG
hooligans	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
excited	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
took	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
motor	I-ARG
racing	I-ARG

using	I-ARG
fireworks	I-ARG
illegally	I-ARG

However,	O
the	B-ARG
hooligans	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
took	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
minority	I-ARG

people	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
sport	B-ARG
events	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
wake	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
love	I-ARG

responsibilities	I-ARG
strongly	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
citizen	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
international	B-ARG
sporting	I-ARG
occasions	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
effective	I-ARG
solutions	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

also	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
stimulant	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

Hence,	O
I	O

some	O

think	O
it's	O
not	O
a	O
good	O

From	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
the	B-ARG
benefits	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
engagement	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
paid	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
outweigh	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
drawbacks	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
children	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
hardship	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
earning	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
kind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
paid	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
looking	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
babies,	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
housework	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
keeping	I-ARG
shops,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
mature	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
situations	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents'	I-ARG
hardship,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
respect	I-ARG
values	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
form	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
habit	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
saving	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
when	O
children	O
take	O
jobs,	O
they	O
tend	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
responsible	O
because	O
whether	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
earn	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
depend	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
effectiveness	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
attitudes	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
.	O
To	B-ARG
keep	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
jobs,	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
finish	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
duties	I-ARG

For	O

if	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
shop	I-ARG
assistant,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
eye	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
products,	I-ARG
calculate	I-ARG
prices	I-ARG
correctly	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
responsibilities	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
lost	I-ARG
.	O
Some	O
people	O
may	O
argue	O
that	O
children	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
material,	I-ARG
neglect	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
study	I-ARG

earning	I-ARG
money	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
exploited	I-ARG

children	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
instructions	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
things	I-ARG

avoid	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
if	B-ARG

some	I-ARG

of	I-ARG
paid	I-ARG

Furthermore,	O
past	B-ARG

a	I-ARG

perform	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

an	I-ARG

depending	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

For	O
instance,	O
a	B-ARG
defendant	I-ARG
with	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	B-ARG
am	I-ARG
skeptical	I-ARG
about	I-ARG

Thus,	O
I	B-ARG
strongly	I-ARG
support	I-ARG

current	I-ARG
laws	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
Great	I-ARG
Britain	I-ARG

Critics	O
may	O

that	O
the	B-ARG

have	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
drawbacks	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

negatively,	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

internet	I-ARG

black	I-ARG

However,	O
we	O
should	O
bear	O
in	O

that	O
these	B-ARG
problems	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
mainly	I-ARG
triggered	I-ARG
by	I-ARG

approach	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
Internet	I-ARG
itself	I-ARG

Thus,	O
what	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
change	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
learners'	I-ARG

an	I-ARG
elimination	I-ARG

After	O

I	B-ARG

Admittedly,	O
encouraging	B-ARG
the	I-ARG

at	I-ARG

fifty-five	I-ARG

has	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
merits	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
fresh	B-ARG
graduates	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
practical	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
applicable	I-ARG
ideas	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
current	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
organisation	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
because	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
instilled	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
imparted	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
updated	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG

skills	I-ARG

.	O
Secondly,	O
having	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
larger	I-ARG
proportion	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adults	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
enhance	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

and	I-ARG
efficiency	I-ARG
.	O
Compared	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
aged	I-ARG
staffs,	I-ARG
younger	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
physically	I-ARG
stronger	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
energetic	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
enables	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
carry	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
heavy	I-ARG
workload	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
deadline	I-ARG

However,	O
sacrificing	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
senior	I-ARG
members	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
save	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
workers	I-ARG
poses	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
influences	I-ARG
.	O
From	B-ARG
personal	I-ARG
level,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
fosters	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sense	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
unfairness	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
older	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
younger	I-ARG
generations	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
undeniable	O
that	O
every	B-ARG
person	I-ARG
within	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
enterprise	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rights	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
proceed	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
capable	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
it,	I-ARG
disregard	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
physical	I-ARG
capacity	I-ARG
.	O
From	B-ARG
social	I-ARG
perspective,	I-ARG
massively	I-ARG
forcing	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
retirement	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
burden	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
sufficient	B-ARG
pension	I-ARG
payments	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
regular	I-ARG
medical	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
given	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
arranged	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
senior	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
imposed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
terminate	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
employment	I-ARG
permanently	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
even	O
though	O
the	B-ARG
introduction	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
retirement	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
benefits,	I-ARG
it	O
is	O
convincing	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
generate	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sense	I-ARG

However,	O
I	O

it's	B-ARG
better	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
two	I-ARG
close	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
casual	I-ARG
acquaintances	I-ARG
.	O
We	O
can	O
not	O
deny	O
that	O
being	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
acquaintant	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
it's	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
anyone	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
believe	O
friends	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
compatibility	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
.	O
After	B-ARG
two	I-ARG
years	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
college	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
found	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
differences	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
similarities,	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
growing	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
families	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
educated	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
.	O
Sometimes	B-ARG
acquaintances	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
acquaintances	I-ARG
.	O
We	B-ARG
spend	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
it's	B-ARG
much	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
casual	I-ARG
acquaintances	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
close	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
close	B-ARG
friends	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
feelings	I-ARG
.	O
Because	O
of	O
the	O
similarity	O
I	O
talked	O
before,	O
acquaintances	B-ARG
probably	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
they	B-ARG
wouldn't	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
spare	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
consider	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
feelings	I-ARG
.	O
Everyone	B-ARG
play	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
acquaintance	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
Being	B-ARG
friendly	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
treat	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
acquaintance	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
sick,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
ask	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
okay	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
acquaintance	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
soon	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
possible	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
wrong	I-ARG
direction	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
trail,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pull	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
back,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
stand	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
stare	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
it's	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
business	I-ARG

And	O
I	O
believe	O
my	B-ARG
friend	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
me	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
a	B-ARG
friend	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
about	I-ARG

To	O
me,	O
friends	B-ARG

prefer	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
pace	I-ARG
condition	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
first	O
and	O
foremost	O
reason	O
lies	O
in	O
the	O
inevitable	O
fact	O
that	O
we	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
save	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
accomplishing	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
tasks,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
fitting	I-ARG
example	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
found	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
missing	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
just	I-ARG
failed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
participate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
entrance	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
because	O
I	B-ARG
thought	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
eating	I-ARG
breakfast	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
transporting	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
testing	I-ARG
place;	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
stocked	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
traffic	I-ARG
jam	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
missed	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
test	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
we	O
can	O
start	O
to	O
agree	O
that	O
we	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
eager	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
.	O
Apart	O
from	O
the	O
one	O
I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
above,	O
another	O
equally	O
important	O
aspect	O
is	O
keeping	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
high	I-ARG
pace	I-ARG
condition	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
lazy	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
avoid	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
sluggish	I-ARG
person,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
probability	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
fulfilling	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
dream	I-ARG
successfully	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	B-ARG
had	I-ARG
spent	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
practicing	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
piano	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
won	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
piano	I-ARG
competition,	I-ARG
defeating	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
spending	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
practicing	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
from	O
this	O
case	O
we	O
are	O
capable	O
of	O
stating	O
that	O
keeping	B-ARG
our	I-ARG
pace	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
.	O
Admittedly,	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
some	O
people	O
proclaiming	O
that	O
with	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
slower	I-ARG
pace	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG

it	B-ARG

them	I-ARG

However,	O
from	O
my	O
limited	O

I	O
just	O
doubt	O
the	O
credibility	O
of	O
that	O

I	B-ARG
do	I-ARG

those	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
with	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

In	O

it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG

Based	O
on	O
the	O
reasons	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
living	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

better	I-ARG

the	B-ARG

If	B-ARG
certain	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
it	B-ARG

The	B-ARG

the	B-ARG
process	I-ARG

When	B-ARG

Living	B-ARG
with	I-ARG

money	I-ARG

If	B-ARG
you	I-ARG

For	O

last	B-ARG

I	I-ARG
shared	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
room	I-ARG

heating	I-ARG

half:	I-ARG

two	I-ARG

I	B-ARG
was	I-ARG

by	I-ARG
sharing	I-ARG
wasted	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
bills	I-ARG

Apart	O
from	O
saving	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
money,	O
living	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
roommate	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
enables	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
socialize	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
easier	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
socialize	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
you	I-ARG

You	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
invite	I-ARG

over	I-ARG

your	I-ARG
room	I-ARG

fun	I-ARG
together	I-ARG

For	O
instance,	O
one	B-ARG
night,	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
roommate,	I-ARG
Millan,	I-ARG
brought	I-ARG
his	I-ARG

Even	B-ARG
though	I-ARG
his	I-ARG

I	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
total	I-ARG
strangers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
quickly	I-ARG
got	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG

We	B-ARG
soon	I-ARG
found	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
loved	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
video	I-ARG
games	I-ARG

We	B-ARG
played	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
video	I-ARG
game	I-ARG
called	I-ARG
'Halo'	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
night,	I-ARG

became	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG

Living	B-ARG

a	I-ARG

made	I-ARG

easier	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
living	B-ARG

a	I-ARG
roommate	I-ARG
allows	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
help	I-ARG

It	B-ARG
often	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
case	I-ARG

your	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG

need	I-ARG

When	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
run	I-ARG

if	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
help	I-ARG

Some	B-ARG
of	I-ARG

may	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
something	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
offer	I-ARG

To	O
illustrate,	O
when	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
computer	I-ARG
mysteriously	I-ARG
broke	I-ARG
down,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
dialed	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
manufacturer	I-ARG

asked	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
help	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
failed	I-ARG

me	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
useful	I-ARG
solutions	I-ARG
.	O
To	B-ARG
my	I-ARG
surprise,	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
roommates	I-ARG
noticed	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
offered	I-ARG

help	I-ARG

He	B-ARG
was	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
computers,	I-ARG

he	I-ARG
managed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
fix	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
quickly	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
while	O
many	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
decide	I-ARG

live	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
reasons,	I-ARG
I	B-ARG
prefer	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
roommate,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
because	O
it	B-ARG
offers	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
advantages,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
spending,	I-ARG
more	I-ARG

believe	O
that	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
fixed	O
punishment	O
for	O
each	O
crime	O
type	O
Generally	O
reason	O
behind	O
punishment	O

a	O

that	O
it	O

what	O

therefore	O
there	O
should	O

a	O

Alternatively	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
consideration	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
situation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
conditions,	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
forces	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all	O
if	B-ARG
there	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
fixed	I-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
type	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
because	O
the	B-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
clear	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
professional	I-ARG
criminals	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
fear	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
committing	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
laws	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
rules	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
therefore	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
look	I-ARG
behind	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
for	O
instance	O
"a	O
women	O

as	O
a	O

The	B-ARG
person	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
committed	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
professional	I-ARG
criminals	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
imprisoned	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
contrary,	O
fixed	B-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
taken	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
judges	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
judgement	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
effective	I-ARG
economically	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Government	I-ARG
.	O
Everyone	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
treated	I-ARG
equally	I-ARG
because	O
sometimes	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
poor	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
hiring	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
lawyer	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
imprisoned	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
committing	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
come	I-ARG
back	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
professional	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore	O
fixed	B-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
space	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
poor	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
rich	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
everyone	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
importance	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
Government	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
decide	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
case	I-ARG

case	I-ARG
basis	I-ARG

In	O

The	B-ARG

If	B-ARG

reduced,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
decrease	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
reason	I-ARG
why	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
enter	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG

In	O
this	O

doing	I-ARG
research,	I-ARG
ignoring	I-ARG
preparing	I-ARG
appropriate	I-ARG
courses	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG

ruin	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
reputation	I-ARG

universities	I-ARG

Students	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
unsatisfied	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Many	B-ARG

these	I-ARG

In	O
this	O

professors	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
assistants	I-ARG

It	B-ARG

Accordingly,	O
spending	B-ARG
more	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

electronic	B-ARG

This	B-ARG

the	B-ARG

Apartments	B-ARG

Both	O

After	O

the	O

the	O

the	O
economic	O
factor,	O
if	O
I	O

I	B-ARG

prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
apartment	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
community	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
dormitories	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
an	B-ARG
apartment	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
freedom	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
dormitory	I-ARG
.	O
While	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
dormitory	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
obey	I-ARG
preset	I-ARG
rules,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
apartment	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
set	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
rules	I-ARG
.	O
You	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
visits	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
left	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
.	O
An	B-ARG
apartment	I-ARG
offers	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
privacy	I-ARG
because	O
you	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
room	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
sharing	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
an	O
important	O
factor	O
because	O
you	O
also	O
get	O
more	O
space	O
than	O
you	O
would	O
in	O
a	O
dormitory	O
.	O
Second,	O
from	O
an	O
economic	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
people	O
often	O
argue	O
that	O
an	B-ARG
apartment	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
expensive	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
is	O
only	O
partially	O
true,	O
you	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
rent	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
extra	I-ARG
rooms	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
apartment	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
rent	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
cheaper	I-ARG
.	O
Transportation	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
issue,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
return	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
everyday	I-ARG

You	O
could	O
choose	O
to	O
use	O
public	O
transportation,	O
a	O
cheaper	O
option,	O
or	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
car	O
.	O
The	B-ARG
car	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
expensive	I-ARG
option,	I-ARG

also	I-ARG
offers	I-ARG
freedom	I-ARG

schedule	I-ARG

Lastly,	O
the	B-ARG
studying	I-ARG
conditions	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
apartment	I-ARG
because	O
you	B-ARG
don't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
noise	I-ARG

distractions	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
often	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
dormitories	I-ARG

A	B-ARG
lot	I-ARG

Since	O
in	B-ARG
an	I-ARG

you	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

you	B-ARG
won't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
this	I-ARG

a	O

you	B-ARG
would	I-ARG

For	O
the	O

reason,	O
you	B-ARG
won't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
one	I-ARG

You	B-ARG

To	O
conclude,	O
both	O

have	O
their	O

personally	O
I	O
think	O
the	B-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
apartment	I-ARG
outshine	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
living	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

Why	O
are	O
groups	O

During	O

that	O
we	O

In	O
my	O
point	O

groups	B-ARG
provide	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

gain	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG

My	O

the	O
following:	O
In	O
the	O
first	O
place,	O
humans	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
part	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
society	I-ARG

groups	I-ARG

Most	O

the	B-ARG

of	I-ARG
socialization,	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
children	I-ARG

.	O
We	B-ARG
begin	I-ARG
taking	I-ARG
part	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
groups	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
organizations	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
days	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
especially	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
continue	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
participation	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
By	B-ARG
making	I-ARG
teamwork,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
schools	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
along	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
.	O
As	B-ARG
university	I-ARG
students,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
join	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
organization	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
major	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
expand	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG

communicate	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
.	O
After	B-ARG
graduating	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
schools,	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
associations	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
various	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
resources	I-ARG
and	I-ARG

Thus,	O
almost	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

By	B-ARG

a	I-ARG
positive	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
obtain	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
experiences	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
particular	I-ARG
purpose	I-ARG

A	B-ARG
solid	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
suited	I-ARG

because	O
it	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
cost	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
college	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
personal's	I-ARG
choice,	I-ARG

there	B-ARG

ways	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
college	I-ARG
education	I-ARG

First,	O
making	B-ARG
college	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
cost	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
divert	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
funds	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
law	I-ARG
enforcement,	I-ARG
infrastructure	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
forth	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
come	I-ARG
first,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
providing	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
care	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
American,	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
improving	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
schools	I-ARG

In	O
addition,	O
it	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG

raise	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
taxes	I-ARG
again	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
again	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
fund	I-ARG
college	I-ARG
education	I-ARG

Consequently,	O
it	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
affect	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
taxpayers	I-ARG
whether	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
funds	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
choice	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
college	I-ARG

Not	B-ARG
everyone	I-ARG

other	O
people	O
decide	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
college	O
education	O

Therefore,	O
those	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
financial	I-ARG
investment	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
choice;	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

other	I-ARG
funds	I-ARG

In	O
addition,	O
the	B-ARG
government	I-ARG
already	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
pay	I-ARG
college	I-ARG
expense	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
indirect	I-ARG
means	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
often	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG

They	B-ARG
also	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
funds	I-ARG

academic	I-ARG
research	I-ARG

While	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
money	I-ARG

individual	I-ARG
students,	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
contributions	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
trivial	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
short,	O
the	B-ARG
individual	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
finance	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
because	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
personal	O

Otherwise,	O

those	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG

Person	B-ARG
'A'	I-ARG
who	I-ARG

a	I-ARG
non-native	I-ARG

country	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
receive	I-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
step-by-step	I-ARG
teaching	I-ARG
method	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
he	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
jumping	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG

Therefore	O
he	B-ARG
can	I-ARG

Besides,	O
all	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
learners	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
probably	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
country,	I-ARG
so	O
all	B-ARG
these	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
learned	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
language,	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
less,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
way	I-ARG

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
when	B-ARG
a	I-ARG

He	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
native	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
participate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
groups	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
members	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
country	I-ARG

No	O
doubt,	O
it	B-ARG
leads	I-ARG

Thus	O
he	B-ARG

When	B-ARG

Using	B-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
advantages	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
modern	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
facing	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
problems:	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
environmental	I-ARG
population,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

the	O

At	O

Some	O

a	O

Yet,	O
I	B-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
individually	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
helps	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
concentrate	I-ARG
more,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
build	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
personality	I-ARG
.	O
Studying	B-ARG
alone	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
focus	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
lessons	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	B-ARG
am	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
type	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
cannot	I-ARG
comprehend	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
unless	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
am	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
schedules,	I-ARG
guidelines,	I-ARG
exercises	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
we	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
require	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
sit	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
math,	I-ARG
reading,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
drawing	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
minute	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
wasting	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG

Additionally,	O
we	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
building	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
personalities	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
answering	B-ARG
our	I-ARG
homework	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
encourages	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
responsible	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
independent	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
it	B-ARG
motivates	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
accurate	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
.	O
Personally,	O
when	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
fix	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
plan	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
specific	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
finish	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
improves	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
ability	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
precise	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
careful	I-ARG

To	O
conclude,	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
ways	O
to	O
study	O

it	O
is	O
our	O
right	O
to	O

for	O
our	O
characters	O
whether	O
alone	O
or	O
with	O

In	O
fact,	O
I	B-ARG
agree	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lone	I-ARG
since	O
it	B-ARG
helps	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
focus	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
establish	I-ARG
my	I-ARG

Success	O

us	O

Some	B-ARG
important	O
characteristics	O
of	O
a	O
co-worker	O
At	O
work,	O
you	O
meet	O
people	O
with	O
diverse	O
backgrounds	O
and	O
you	O
are	O
required	O
to	O
maintain	O
sound	O
relationships	O
with	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
pleasant	O
work	O
environment	O
.	O
However,	O
the	O
relationship	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
maintain	O
with	O
your	O
co-worker	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
one	O
since	O
he	O
or	O
she	O
is	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
works	O
very	O
closely	O
with	O
you,	O
and	O
in	O
most	O
instances	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
rely	O
on	O
him	O
or	O
her	O
.	O
Therefore	O
in	O
my	O
view,	O
a	B-ARG
good	I-ARG
co-worker	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
three	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
characteristics	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
cooperation,	I-ARG
trustworthiness,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
fellowship	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
co-workers	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
cooperative	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
cooperate,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
lots	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
disputes	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
once	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
co-worker	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
conscious	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore	O
he	B-ARG
always	I-ARG
left	I-ARG
office	I-ARG
sharp	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
giving	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
consideration	I-ARG
whether	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
finished	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
.	O
Most	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
protect	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
caught	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
supervisor	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
authoritative	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
one	B-ARG
day	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
wanted	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
off	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
mother	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
doctor	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
requested	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
co-worker	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
helping	I-ARG
hand	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
finish	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
early,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
turned	I-ARG
down	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
request	I-ARG
giving	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
silly	I-ARG
excuse	I-ARG
.	O
From	B-ARG
that	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
onwards	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
offer	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
support	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
finally	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
transferred	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
department	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
distant	I-ARG
location	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
irresponsibility	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
I	O
believe	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
co-workers	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
corporate	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
devastating	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
co-workers	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
trust	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
act	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
suspicion	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
aspect	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
came	I-ARG
across	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
situation	I-ARG
once	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
subordinates	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
suspect	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
co-worker	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
carrying	I-ARG
tales	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
.	O
To	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
certain	I-ARG
extent	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
suspicion	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
valid	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
co-worker	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
attempts	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
highlight	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
drawbacks	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
.	O
However	O
I	B-ARG
never	I-ARG
encourage	I-ARG
tale	I-ARG
carriers	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
principle	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
therefore	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
co-worker	I-ARG
gave	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
talking	I-ARG
ill	I-ARG
against	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
.	O
But	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
mistrust	I-ARG
continued	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
created	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
unpleasant	I-ARG
situations	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
everybody	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
department	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
the	B-ARG
co-workers	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
believe	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
fellowship	I-ARG
.	O
This	B-ARG
helps	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
enjoy	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
building	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
strong	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
relationships	I-ARG
.	O
After	O
all,	O
you	B-ARG
spend	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
office	I-ARG
.	O
If	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
good	O
company	O
in	O
office,	O
it	O
is	O
certainly	O
a	O
blessing	O

Distance	O
learning	O

During	O
these	O
digital	O
age,	O
the	O

has	O
become	O
more	O

and	O
more	O
common	O
in	O
the	O
society	O
.	O
Almost	O
every	O
school	O
develops	O
their	O
online	O
class	O
systems	O
.	O
One	O
question	O
I	O
always	O
thought	O
about	O
is	O
whether	O
online	O
computer	O
classes	O
should	O
replace	O
classroom	O
learning	O
.	O
Although,	O
online	B-ARG
classes	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
advantages,	I-ARG
for	O
me,	O
I	B-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
traditional	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
First,	O
the	B-ARG
participant	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
classmates	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
factor	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
.	O
Working	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
discussion	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
opinion	I-ARG
among	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
the	B-ARG
discussion	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
results	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
expanded	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
vision	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
respect	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
roommate's	I-ARG
ideas	I-ARG
.	O
Unlike	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
distance	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
few	I-ARG
opportunities	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
discuss	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
classroom	B-ARG
learning	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
studying	I-ARG
.	O
During	B-ARG
student's	I-ARG
free	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
join,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
sports,	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
lab,	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
library	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
activities	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
interact	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
.	O
Connection	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
improves	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
IQ	I-ARG
abilities,	I-ARG
furthermore,	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
societies	I-ARG
.	O
While	O
the	B-ARG
online	I-ARG
course	I-ARG
keeps	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
.	O
Lastly,	O
in	B-ARG
school,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
guided	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
needed	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
advice	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
professor	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
answers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
helping	I-ARG
you,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
alone	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
got	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
contrast,	O
in	B-ARG
distance	I-ARG
learning,	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
aspects	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
professor	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
reduced	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
professor	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
assigned	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
there	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
response	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
ask	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
question	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
traditional	B-ARG
learning	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
But	O
in	O
the	O
future,	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
the	O
distance	O
learning	O
become	O
more	O
popular	O
and	O
ordinary	O
in	O
schools	O
.	O

Non	O
academic	O
subjects	O
should	O
be	O
removed	O
from	O
syllabus	O
Students	O
have	O
become	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
stressed	O
during	O
the	O
last	O
few	O
years	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
increase	O
in	O
academic	O
tasks	O
assigned	O
by	O
their	O
teachers	O
to	O
improve	O
their	O
academic	O
success	O
.	O
While	O
some	O
people	O
believe	O
that	O
non-academic	B-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
completely	I-ARG
removed,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
strongly	I-ARG
disagree	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
begin	O
with,	O
from	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
point	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
view,	I-ARG
schools	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
deliver	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
physical	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
removed	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
syllabus,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
considerable	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
students’	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
after	B-ARG
studying	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
sitting	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
classroom	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
whole	I-ARG
morning,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
outdoor	I-ARG
activities,	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
stretching,	I-ARG
jogging	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
ball	I-ARG
games,	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
ability	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
afternoon	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG

will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
harmful	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
people’s	I-ARG
health,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
decrease	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
capability	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
schools	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
responsible	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
developing	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
into	I-ARG
well-rounded	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
success	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
academically	I-ARG
.	O
Success	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ultimate	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
student,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
requires	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
knowledge,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
practical	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
cooking,	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
teamwork	I-ARG
spirit	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
school	B-ARG
education	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
focus	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
development	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
student	I-ARG
as	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
crucial	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
independent	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Some	O
people	O
may	O
argue	O
that	O
students	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
practical	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
because	O
most	B-ARG
young	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
watch	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
computer	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
parents	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
usually	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
busy	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
teach	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
non-academic	B-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
subjects	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

Therefore,	O

I	B-ARG

are	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
suffer	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
shock,	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
difference	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
two	I-ARG
cultures	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
custom	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
form	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
following	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
custom	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
way	I-ARG

if	B-ARG

As	O
a	O
result,	O
people	B-ARG
understand	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

adapt	I-ARG

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
keeping	B-ARG

One	B-ARG
example	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
Chinese	I-ARG

1969	I-ARG

While	B-ARG

private	I-ARG
cars	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
buried	I-ARG

Everyone	O

These	O

moments	O

both	O
in	O
their	O
childhood	O

their	O
adulthood	O

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
childhood	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
happiest	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
in	B-ARG
childhood	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
happier	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
adulthood	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
worry	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
bills,	I-ARG
jobs,	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
just	I-ARG
worry	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
two	I-ARG
things:	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
fun,	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
.	O
A	B-ARG
child's	I-ARG
daily	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
school,	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
sleeping	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
when	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
came	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
took	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
bike	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
soccer	I-ARG
ball	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
neighborhood	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
I	B-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
worry	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
costs	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
things,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
had	I-ARG
fun	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
learned	I-ARG
.	O
Also,	O
people	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
creative	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
children,	I-ARG
children	B-ARG
imagine	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
games	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
fun	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
happy	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
childhood	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
period	I-ARG
where	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
school	B-ARG
memories	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
memories	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
learn,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
love,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
long-lasting	I-ARG
friendships	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
of-course	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
fun	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
my	B-ARG
father's	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
moments	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
years	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
he	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
in-touch	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
classmates	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
share	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
childhood	I-ARG
memories	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
childhood	B-ARG
is,	I-ARG
indeed,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
happiest	I-ARG
moments	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
There	O
is	O
only	O
one	O
life	O

one	O
childhood	O

live	O
their	O
childhood	O
thoroughly	O

Learning	O
to	O

for	O
young	O
adults	O
.	O
However,	O
how	O
early	O
the	O
children	O
leave	O
their	O
parents	O
is	O
a	O
difficult	O
issue	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
staying	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
disadvantages	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
.	O
My	O
opinion	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
creating	O
memories	O
with	O
parents,	O
saving	O
money,	O
and	O
taking	O
advice	O
from	O
parents	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
significant	O
upsides	O
is	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
young	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
young	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
create	I-ARG
memories	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
dad	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
mom	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
early	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
having	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
low	I-ARG
possibilities	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
hometown	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
he	I-ARG
lives	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
time,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
chances	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
share	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
feelings,	I-ARG
exercise,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
travel	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
.	O
All	B-ARG
memories	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
priceless	I-ARG
treasure	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
passes	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
I	O
think	O
undergoing	B-ARG
with	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
worthwhile	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
living	B-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
costs	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
outside	I-ARG
.	O
Learning	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
independent	I-ARG
means	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
he	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
rent	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
house	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rental	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
burden	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
another	B-ARG
daily	I-ARG
expense	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
considerable	I-ARG
outgoings	I-ARG
.	O
Spending	B-ARG
much	I-ARG
money	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
expect	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
a	O
word,	O
the	B-ARG
parents	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
save	I-ARG
money,	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
third	O
convincing	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
young	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
father	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
mother's	I-ARG
suggestions	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
dilemma,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
comfort	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
hand	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
familiar	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
suitable	I-ARG
advice	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
parents	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
immediately,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
suffer	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
pain	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
taking	B-ARG
advice	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
parents,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
adult	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
through	I-ARG
obstacles	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
living	B-ARG

Hence,	O

the	O
statement	O

I	O

the	B-ARG

invaluable	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
beings	I-ARG

It	B-ARG

It	B-ARG
helps	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
out	I-ARG

Also,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
interesting	I-ARG
travel	I-ARG
location	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O
the	B-ARG
zoo	I-ARG
gives	I-ARG
humans	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG

When	O
you	O

what	O
should	O
you	O
do	O
if	O
there	O

no	O
zoo?	O
Inevitably,	O
the	B-ARG
zoo	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
innate	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
zoo	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
let	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
biology	I-ARG
practically	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
observe	I-ARG
animals'	I-ARG
behaviors	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
features	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
practical	B-ARG
learning	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
relax	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
boring	I-ARG
lecture	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
.	O
Besides,	O
researchers	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
zoo	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
pick	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
examples	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
researches	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
diverse	I-ARG
species	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
the	B-ARG
zoo	I-ARG
preserves	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
rare	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
safe	I-ARG
habitats	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
zoo,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
harmful	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
forest	I-ARG

They,	B-ARG
fed	I-ARG

zookeepers,	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
need	I-ARG

find	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG

Furthermore,	O
we	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
artificial	I-ARG
insemenation	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
maintain	I-ARG
nearly	I-ARG
extinct	I-ARG
wildlife	I-ARG

Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
because	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
weird,	I-ARG
acute,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
beautiful	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
zoo,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
tourist	I-ARG
attraction	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
tourists	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
seek	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
closely	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
zoo	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
large	I-ARG
number	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
national	I-ARG

foreign	I-ARG
tourists,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
receive	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG

money	I-ARG

That	B-ARG
also	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
money	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
the	B-ARG
zoo	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
saves	I-ARG
animals	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
danger	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
extinction,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
around	I-ARG

have	I-ARG
better	I-ARG

I	O

useful	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
spending	B-ARG
the	I-ARG

is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

Many	B-ARG
governments	I-ARG
believe	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
space	I-ARG
exploration	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
activity	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
wastes	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

while	O
the	B-ARG
essential	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
discovery	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
living	I-ARG

In	B-ARG
20th	I-ARG

finding	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
living	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
planet	I-ARG

impossible	I-ARG
until	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
during	I-ARG
history,	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
planet	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
threatening	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
other	I-ARG

an	I-ARG
enormous	I-ARG

Therefore,	O
it	B-ARG

In	O
this	O

I	O
will	O

two	O
reasons	O

my	O
opinion	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
a	B-ARG
mistake	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
last	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
friendship	I-ARG
lasts	I-ARG
forever	I-ARG
.	O
Anybody	B-ARG
does	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
remember	I-ARG
mistakes	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
someone	I-ARG
remembers	I-ARG
mistake,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
closed	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
mistakes	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
forgotten	I-ARG
quickly	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
my	B-ARG
friend	I-ARG
Lee	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
mistake	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
broke	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
precious	I-ARG
gift	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
I	B-ARG
forgot	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
two	I-ARG
days,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
felt	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
peace	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
.	O
Some	O
people	O
might	O
say	O
I	O
am	O
silly,	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
mistake	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
forgettable	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
friendship	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
Everybody	B-ARG
makes	I-ARG
mistake	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
if	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
friendship	I-ARG
whenever	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
mistake,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
around	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
agree	O
if	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
mistake,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
friendship	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
when	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
mistake	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
problem,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
forgive	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
because	O
a	B-ARG
friend	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
gift	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
According	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
research,	I-ARG
85%	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
answered	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
gift	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
a	B-ARG
mistake	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
brake	I-ARG
friendship	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
big	I-ARG

friendship	B-ARG

forever	I-ARG

Students	O
should	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
take	O
regular	O
standardized	O
tests	O
The	O
issue	O
at	O
hand	O
is	O
if	O
the	O
schools	O
should	O
require	O
students	O
to	O
take	O
regular	O
standardized	O
exams	O
.	O
This	O
issue	O
is	O
important	O
because	O
nowadays	O
many	O
people	O
cast	O
doubt	O
on	O
it	O
.	O
However,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
standardized	B-ARG
tests	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
option	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
educational	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
really	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
standardized	B-ARG
tests	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
preferable	I-ARG
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
they	B-ARG
help	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
fairly	I-ARG
grade	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example	O
some	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
active	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
lessons,	I-ARG
cause	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
already	I-ARG
familiar	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
issue	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
exams	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
see	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
abilities	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
many	B-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
rely	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
exam	I-ARG
results	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
grading	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
class,	I-ARG
so	O
the	B-ARG
usage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
standardized	I-ARG
tests	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
superior	I-ARG
option	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
Additionally,	O
standardized	B-ARG
tests	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
apply	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
practice	I-ARG
.	O
Since,	O
some	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
simply	I-ARG
rewriting	I-ARG
solved	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
blackboard,	I-ARG
so	O
they	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
try	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
solve	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
standardized	B-ARG
tests	I-ARG
offer	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
schools	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
require	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
standardized	I-ARG
tests,	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
option	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
sides	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
requirement	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
standardized	I-ARG
tests	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
choice,	I-ARG
since	O
in	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
case	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
compare	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
level	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
any	I-ARG
class	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
show	I-ARG
low	I-ARG
academic	I-ARG
performance,	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
intensively	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
support	O
the	O
points	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
say	O
that	O
standardized	B-ARG
tests	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
required	I-ARG
over	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
don’t	I-ARG
because	O
if	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
teacher	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
know	I-ARG

that	O
these	B-ARG

What's	O

people	B-ARG

Those	B-ARG

more	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG

Life	O
in	O
a	O
city	O

much	O
better	O
than	O
life	O
in	O
the	O
countryside	O
As	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
concerned,	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
statement	O
that	O
life	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
countryside	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
in	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
system	I-ARG
.	O
This	O
means,	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
schools	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
universities	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
equipped	I-ARG
classes	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
famous	I-ARG
professors	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
places	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
city	B-ARG
provides	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
opportunities	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
countryside	I-ARG
.	O
There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
jobs,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
well-paid	I-ARG
.	O
Of	O
course	O
living	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
expensive,	I-ARG
but	O
incomes	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
too	O
.	O
Moreover,	O
in	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
urban	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
means,	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
diversity	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
huge	I-ARG
.	O
Meeting	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
knowing	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
tradition	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
unforgettable	I-ARG
experience,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
influence	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
one's	I-ARG
previous	I-ARG
habits	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
the	B-ARG
city	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
well-organised	I-ARG
lines	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
transport	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
buses	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
trains	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
frequent	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
countryside,	I-ARG
so	O
the	B-ARG
city	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
in	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
countryside	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
places	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
rest,	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
its	I-ARG
location	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
peaceful	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
close	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
nature	I-ARG
areas	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
avoid	I-ARG
worries	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
sadness	I-ARG
.	O
Taking	O
all	O
into	O
account,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
living	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
nowadays,	I-ARG
because	O
of	O
the	O
opportunities	O
it	O
gives	O
.	O
Today	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
rural	O
places	O
is	O
in	O
most	O
causes	O
connected	O
with	O
agrarian	O
lifestyle,	O
which	O
for	O
me	O
is	O
without	O
perspective	O
.	O
If	O
I	O
could	O
decide	O
I	O
would	O
chose	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
for	O
sure	O

E-mail	O

e-mail,	O

or	O
just	O
traditional	O

However,	O
I	B-ARG
prefer	I-ARG
e-mail	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
3	I-ARG
reasons:	I-ARG
convenience,	I-ARG
honest	I-ARG
expression	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
fluency	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
communicating	I-ARG
.	O
Everyone	O
agrees	O
that	O
e-mail	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG
.	O
You	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
talk	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
thousands	I-ARG
mile	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
if	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
Vietnam	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
US	I-ARG
-	I-ARG
half	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
Earth,	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
matter	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
far	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
contact	I-ARG
.	O
We	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
worry	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
mails	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
sent	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
address	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
address	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
wrong,	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
e-mail	B-ARG
doesn't	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
time:	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
click	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
writing	B-ARG
e-mail	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
honestly	I-ARG
.	O
Some	O
people	O
think	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
face-to-face	I-ARG
conversations	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
stupid	I-ARG
.	O
Sometimes,	B-ARG
their	I-ARG
ideas	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
expressed	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
exactly	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
expect	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	B-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
talk	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
friend	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
ticklish	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
behavior,	I-ARG
it's	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
explain	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
she	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
e-mail	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
tool	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
speak	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
.	O
She	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
read	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
e-mail	I-ARG
instead	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
listening	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
voice	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
annoyed	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
don't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
worry	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
thing	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
opinion	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
unpersuasive	I-ARG
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
every	B-ARG
communication	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
fluency	I-ARG
so	O
people	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
exactly	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
remember	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
.	O
Voice	B-ARG
email	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
face-to-face	I-ARG
conversations	I-ARG
sometimes	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
reserve	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
very	I-ARG
confident	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
when	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
face	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
parents,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
can't	I-ARG
speak	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
consecutively	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
stop	I-ARG
me,	I-ARG
speak	I-ARG
something	I-ARG
against	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
forget	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
say	I-ARG
.	O
Anyone	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
once	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
conversation	I-ARG
.	O
E-mail	B-ARG
helps	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
arrange	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
perfectly	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
persuasive	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
whole,	O
to	O
compare	O
to	O
all	O
ways	O
of	O
communication,	O
I	O
really	O
think	O
that	O
e-mail	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
greatest	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
major	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
.	O
Its	B-ARG
convenience	I-ARG

our	I-ARG

Additionally,	O
honesty	O

necessary	O
for	O
every	O

can't	O

Communicating	O
via	O
e-mail	O
and	O
voice	O
mail	O
vs	O
Telephone	O
and	O
face-to	O
face	O
Although	O
many	O
people	O
prefer	O
communicating	O
by	O
telephone	O
or	O
face-to-face,	O
personally	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
communicating	B-ARG
by	I-ARG
e-mails	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
voice	I-ARG
mails	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
.	O
There	O
are	O
several	O
reasons	O
to	O
support	O
this	O
idea	O
which	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
mention	O
in	O
this	O
essay	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
communicating	B-ARG
by	I-ARG
e-mail	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
.	O
Many	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
calling	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
acquainted	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
this	I-ARG
case	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
difficult	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
write	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
e-mail	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
voice	I-ARG
mail	I-ARG
because	O
even	B-ARG
shy	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
confident	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
you	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
write	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
e-mail	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
for	O
me,	O
I	B-ARG
work	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
university	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
don't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
spare	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
during	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
get	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
midnight	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
answer	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
questions	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
solve	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
routine	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
might	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
call	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
her	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
appropriate	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
so	O
for	B-ARG
me	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
voice	I-ARG
mail	I-ARG
.	O
Thirdly,	O
when	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
write	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
e-mail	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
carefully	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
writing	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
yourself	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
you	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
change	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
word	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
choose	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
appropriate	I-ARG
style	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
sound	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
polite	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
speak	I-ARG
face-to-face	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG

Should	O
we	O
require	O
our	O
young	O
children	O
to	O
learn	O
music	O
and	O
art	O
Every	O
parents	O
expect	O
their	O
children	O
to	O
be	O
outstanding	O
and	O
successful	O
.	O
In	O
order	O
to	O
achieve	O
this,	O
they	O
start	O
cultivating	O
their	O
children	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
young	O
.	O
In	O
addition	O
to	O
basic	O
knowledge	O
like	O
language	O
or	O
science,	O
music	O
and	O
art	O
are	O
usually	O
on	O
the	O
must-learn	O
list	O
of	O
the	O
parents	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
children	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
age	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
contribute	I-ARG
several	I-ARG
merits	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
First,	O
it's	B-ARG
very	I-ARG
suitable	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
develop	I-ARG
senses	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
.	O
Children	B-ARG
absorb	I-ARG
things	I-ARG
quickly	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
bear	I-ARG
exact	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ability	I-ARG
needed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
art-imagination	I-ARG
.	O
Music	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
math	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
strict	I-ARG
rules	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
abstract,	I-ARG
requiring	I-ARG
creativity	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
imagination	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
enriched	I-ARG
.	O
Children	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
privileged	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
abilities	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
given	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
freedom	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
imagination	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
yet	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
killed	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
reality	I-ARG
circumstances	I-ARG
.	O
Even	B-ARG
if	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
performances	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
simple	I-ARG
drawings	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
melodies,	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
children's	I-ARG
joy	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
flying	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
imagination	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
music	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
life-long	I-ARG
cultivation	I-ARG
worthy	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
investing	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
teach	I-ARG
us	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
appreciate	I-ARG
beauty	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
express	I-ARG
feelings	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
creative	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
essential	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
spiritual	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
even	B-ARG
if	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
musicians	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
artists,	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
worthy	I-ARG
because	O
it	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
nourish	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
temper	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
serve	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
leisure	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
some	O
people	O
might	O
argue	O
that	O
parents	B-ARG
shouldn't	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
stress	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
children,	I-ARG
since	O
learning	B-ARG
too	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
seems	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
burden	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
it	B-ARG
depends	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
value	I-ARG
these	I-ARG
learning	I-ARG
activities	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
parents	I-ARG
push	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
5	I-ARG
years	I-ARG
old	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
play	I-ARG
piano	I-ARG
8	I-ARG
hours	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
day	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
professional	I-ARG
performer,	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
child	I-ARG
stage,	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
open	I-ARG
door	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
introduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
training	I-ARG
area	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
acquire	I-ARG
specific	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
this	O
way,	O
it	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
young	B-ARG
age	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
perfect	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
children	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
music	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
and	O
they	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
indeed	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
young	I-ARG
stage,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
stage	I-ARG
.	O
Music	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
art	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
accompany	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
spirit	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
long	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
given	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
enter	I-ARG
his/her	I-ARG
life	I-ARG

But	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
concerned,	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
idea,	O
which	O
is	O
that	O
there	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
decrease	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
cars	I-ARG

in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
.	O
The	O
following	O
reasons	O
will	O
present	O
my	O
points	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
since	O
the	B-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
improved,	I-ARG
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
convenience	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
subway	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bus	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
I	B-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
jam	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
morning	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
doesn't	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
parking	I-ARG
lots	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cars	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
with	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
stations	I-ARG
increased	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
willing	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
drive	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
a	B-ARG
driving	I-ARG
car	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
pollutions	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
world	I-ARG
.	O
So,	O
with	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
risen	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
aware	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
environment,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
whether	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
drive	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
instead	B-ARG
of	I-ARG
driving	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
one's	I-ARG
car,	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
put	I-ARG
forty	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bus,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
solve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
traffic	I-ARG
jam	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
decrease	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
cars	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
air	I-ARG
pollution	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
.	O
Although,	O
I	O
am	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
reducing	O
of	O
the	O
car	O
use	O
will	O
be	O
achieve	O
in	O
twenty	O
years	O
.	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
still	O
have	O
to	O
point	O
out	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
different	O
points	O
of	O
view	O
.	O
People	O
who	O
hold	O
different	O
opinion	O
may	O
argue	O
that	O
a	B-ARG
personal	I-ARG
car	I-ARG
uses	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
because	O
a	B-ARG
public	I-ARG
transportation	I-ARG
can't	I-ARG
meet	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
.	O
Of	O
course,	O
it	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
true	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
countryside	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
inconvenience	I-ARG
places	I-ARG

However,	O
no	B-ARG

you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
going	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
somewhere	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
trip	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
simply	I-ARG
live	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
suburbs	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
on,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
ways	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
do,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
ride	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
bike,	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
walk	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
feet	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
reduce	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
car	I-ARG
use,	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
health	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
this	O
way,	O
this	B-ARG
won't	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
problem	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
all	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O

the	O
reasons	O
described	O
above,	O
when	O
the	O
advantages	O

the	O

Working	O

Working	O
in	O
a	O

Due	O

the	O

This	O
rapid	O
progress	O

leads	O
to	O
the	O
question	O
whether	O
it's	O
better	O
working	O
at	O

with	O
a	O
computer	O
and	O
a	O
phone	O
than	O
working	O
at	O
the	O
company's	O
office	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
working	B-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
worse	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
efficient	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
office	I-ARG
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
while	B-ARG
working	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
office,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
interact	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
colleges	I-ARG
instantly	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
either	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
colleges	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
discuss	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
.	O
Think	B-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
big	I-ARG
project	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
on,	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
group	I-ARG
member	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
new	I-ARG
idea	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
project,	I-ARG
he/she	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
assemble	I-ARG
his/her	I-ARG
colleges	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
discuss	I-ARG
.	O
It's	B-ARG
more	I-ARG
efficient	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
straight-forward	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
talking	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
phone	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
another	O
example,	O
if	B-ARG
one’s	I-ARG
computer	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
Internet	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
breakdown,	I-ARG
he/she	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
call	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
MIS	I-ARG
staff	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
fix	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
working	B-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
disadvantages	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
doubt	I-ARG
lower	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
efficiency	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
works	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
people	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
easily	I-ARG
distracted	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
.	O
It's	B-ARG
hard	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
concentrate	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
grab	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
remote	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
junk	I-ARG
foods	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
away	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
while	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
supervising	I-ARG
them,	I-ARG
thus	I-ARG
raises	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
chance	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
loafing	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
people	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
work	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
miss	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
events	I-ARG
happening	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
office,	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
announcements	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
boss	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
working	B-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
office	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
obviously	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
home	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
terms	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
efficiency	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
colleges	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
provides	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
working	I-ARG
atmosphere	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
never	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
grasped	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

success	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
job	I-ARG
for	O
following	O
reasons:	O
We	B-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
theoritical	I-ARG
basis	I-ARG

This	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
done	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
school	I-ARG

In	B-ARG
school,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
able	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
identify	I-ARG
skills	I-ARG
required	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
future	I-ARG
job	I-ARG

work	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
mastering	I-ARG

learning	I-ARG
them	I-ARG

If	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
study	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
hard,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

For	O

if	O
someone	O

As	O
you	O
can	O
see,	O
studying	B-ARG
hard	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
factor	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
succeed	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG

One	B-ARG

the	I-ARG

effective	I-ARG
commuincation	I-ARG
.	O
By	B-ARG
relating	I-ARG
well	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
we	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
likely	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
lot	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
friends	I-ARG
and	O
therefore	O
we	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
wide	I-ARG
network	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
communication	I-ARG

Commuincation	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
benefits	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
if	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
getting	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
job,	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
commuincating	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
offering	I-ARG
jobs	I-ARG
whom	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
treat	I-ARG
well	I-ARG

therefore	O
they	B-ARG
respect	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
well,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG

Or,	O
if	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
salesman	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
store	I-ARG

any	I-ARG

place,	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
relating	I-ARG
well	I-ARG

your	I-ARG

you	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

your	I-ARG
regular	I-ARG

So,	O
relating	B-ARG

is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG

we	B-ARG

First	O

is	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
entirely	I-ARG

on	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
eating	I-ARG
habit	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
key	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
forming	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
eating	I-ARG
pattern	I-ARG
lies	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
concept	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
wholesome	I-ARG
diets	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
self-control	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
sure	O
that	O
advertising	B-ARG
always	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
tempting,	I-ARG
regardless	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
whether	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
negative	I-ARG
effects	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
body	I-ARG

However,	O
advertising	B-ARG

the	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
information	I-ARG

for	I-ARG
people	I-ARG

People	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
still	I-ARG
acquire	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
viewpoints	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
foods	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
sources,	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
news	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
magazines	I-ARG

As	B-ARG
long	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
clear	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
maintain	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
body	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
persistently	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
track	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
eating	I-ARG
habits,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
successfully	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
temptations	I-ARG
.	O
It	B-ARG
will	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
persuasive	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
blame	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
sector	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
fast-food	I-ARG
company	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
making	I-ARG
them	I-ARG

fat	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
reassess	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
behaviors	I-ARG

Second,	O
in	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
era	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
becoming	I-ARG
conscious	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
healthier	I-ARG
lifestyle,	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
companies	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
actually	I-ARG
aiming	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
rising	I-ARG
trend	I-ARG

start	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
promote	I-ARG
healthy	I-ARG
foods	I-ARG

In	O
other	O
words,	O
advertising	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
healthier	I-ARG
eating	I-ARG
habits	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
people	I-ARG

Think	B-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
recently	I-ARG
popular	I-ARG
organic	I-ARG
foods	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
claimed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
grow	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
without	I-ARG

those	I-ARG
crude	I-ARG
foods	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
salt	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
less	I-ARG
sugar	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
added	I-ARG

These	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
main	I-ARG
traits	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
advertising	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
hitting	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
overall	I-ARG
results	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
good	I-ARG

In	O
these	O
cases,	O
the	B-ARG
advertising	I-ARG

people's	I-ARG
awareness	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
advertising	B-ARG
is	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
primary	I-ARG
reason	I-ARG

unhealthy	I-ARG

Besides,	O
advertising	B-ARG
might	I-ARG
lead	I-ARG

In	O
the	O

I	O

this	O

First,	O
when	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
facts	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
school,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
ready	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
facing	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
own	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
graduations	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
case	O
in	O
point,	O
more	B-ARG
information	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
facts	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
familiar	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
real	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
concepts	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
they	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
prepare	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
encounter	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
solve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
problems	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
it	B-ARG
would	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
students'	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
students	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
rely	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
concepts	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
ideas	I-ARG
theorically,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
realize	I-ARG
human's	I-ARG

very	I-ARG
well	I-ARG

They	O
should	O
understand	O
objects	O
more	O
that	O
concepts	O
to	O
obtain	O
the	O
ability	O
of	O
analyzing	O
matters	O
well	O
.	O
Thus,	O
if	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
facts,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
realize	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
situations	I-ARG
effectively	I-ARG

so	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
social	I-ARG

Moreover,	O
these	O

are	O
teached	O

their	O
fears	O
and	O
concerns	O
in	O
facing	O
facts	O

As	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
fact,	O
when	B-ARG
a	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

its	I-ARG
consequences,	I-ARG
he	I-ARG

In	O
my	O

In	O
the	O

First,	O
besides	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
body	I-ARG

In	O
my	O

our	B-ARG

As	O
a	O

I	O
decided	O

it	O

very	O

the	I-ARG

be	I-ARG
prepared	I-ARG

present	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
graduation	I-ARG

Thus	O
social	B-ARG
activities	I-ARG

help	I-ARG
them	I-ARG

In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
social	B-ARG
groups	I-ARG

classes	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
significant	I-ARG
factors	I-ARG

prepare	I-ARG

So,	O

In	O
my	O

I	O

begin	O
with,	O
going	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
country	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
good	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
stimulate	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
learn	I-ARG
language	I-ARG

For	O
example,	O
everyone	B-ARG
around	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
speaks	I-ARG
foreign	I-ARG
language,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
then	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
myself	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
communicate	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
people	I-ARG

If	B-ARG
I	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
communicate	I-ARG

people,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
buy	I-ARG
food	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
sacrifice	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
hunger	I-ARG

This	B-ARG
environment	I-ARG

me	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

be	I-ARG

language	I-ARG

Secondly,	O
having	B-ARG
friend	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
speaks	I-ARG
another	I-ARG

help	I-ARG
people	I-ARG

professional	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
faster	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
English	B-ARG
school	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
outside	I-ARG
my	I-ARG

there	I-ARG
are	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
only	I-ARG
language	I-ARG
that	I-ARG

Thus,	O
I	B-ARG

progress	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
personally	O
believe	O
that	O
learning	B-ARG

better	I-ARG
than	I-ARG

Besides,	O

Learning	B-ARG

Getting	O
opinions	O

many	O

Thereby,	O
evaluating	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
ways	O

quality	O
of	O

Not	O

the	O

Therefore,	O
I	O

this	O

Evaluating	B-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
teachers'	I-ARG
performance	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
evaluation	B-ARG
made	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
similar	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
feedback	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
customer	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
business	I-ARG
owners	I-ARG
need	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
know	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
product	I-ARG
.	O
Students	B-ARG
might	I-ARG
complain	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
spoke	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
fast	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
catch	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
teachers	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
speaking	I-ARG
slower	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
sure	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
evaluating	B-ARG
from	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
teachers'	I-ARG
performance	I-ARG
.	O
Additionally,	O
this	B-ARG
evaluation	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
schools'	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
.	O
Teachers	B-ARG
could	I-ARG
augment	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG

Consequently,	O
When	B-ARG
school	I-ARG
gather	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
performance,	I-ARG
school	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
gaining	I-ARG
higher	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG

For	O
instance,	O
in	B-ARG
many	I-ARG
cooperation	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
Microsoft	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
produce	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
products	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
employees	I-ARG
whose	I-ARG
performance	I-ARG

very	I-ARG
high	I-ARG

Schools	B-ARG

students	I-ARG
because	O
school	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
always	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
quality	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
evaluation	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
people	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
get	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
advantage	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
evaluation	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
.	O
Students	B-ARG
could	I-ARG

that	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
experienced	I-ARG

greater	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

I	O

that	O
a	B-ARG
person	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
trying	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
goals	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
committing	B-ARG
to	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
creating	I-ARG
personal	I-ARG
worth	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
I	B-ARG
realized	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
true	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
body	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
mind	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
decided	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
train	I-ARG
myself	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
.	O
Even	B-ARG
if	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
were	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
win	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
medal,	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
acknowledged	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
amount	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
endeavor	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
keep	I-ARG
my	I-ARG
tired	I-ARG
legs	I-ARG
running	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
one	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
learns	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
difficulty	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
stronger	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
remembered	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
suffered	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
round	I-ARG
when	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
was	I-ARG
last	I-ARG
person	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
touched	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
line	I-ARG
.	O
However,	O
I	B-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
up,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
believed	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
I	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
next	I-ARG
round	I-ARG
because	O
I	B-ARG
knew	I-ARG
how	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
improve	I-ARG
myself	I-ARG
.	O
I	B-ARG
had	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
loser	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
thousand	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
first	I-ARG
winning,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
suffering	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
losing	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
competition	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
me	I-ARG
stronger	I-ARG
.	O
Thirdly,	O
at	O
some	O
point,	O
we,	B-ARG
as	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
average	I-ARG
people,	I-ARG
might	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
our	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
heavy	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
carry	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
.	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
worthy	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
carrying	I-ARG
.	O
When	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
distance	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
longer	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
harder	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
achieve,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
runner	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
beyond	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
limit	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
proud	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
himself	I-ARG
.	O
He	B-ARG
can	I-ARG
feel	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
sweetness	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
triumph	I-ARG
because	O
he	B-ARG
did	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
stop	I-ARG
pursing	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
these	O
reasons,	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
one	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
give	I-ARG
up,	I-ARG
as	O
the	B-ARG
true	I-ARG
reward	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
dignity	I-ARG
.	O
Anyone	B-ARG
who	I-ARG
wants	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
achieve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
goal	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
acknowledge	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
effort	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
experience	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
suffering	I-ARG
helps	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
true	I-ARG
potential	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
his	I-ARG
strength,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
ultimately,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
prompt	I-ARG
him	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
ready	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
overcoming	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
greater	I-ARG

Although	O
I	O

technology	B-ARG
may	I-ARG

people's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
complicated	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
aspects,	I-ARG
the	B-ARG
convenience	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
brings	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
what	O
follows,	O
I	O
will	O
illustrate	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
.	O
First,	O
when	B-ARG
it	I-ARG
comes	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
field	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
transportation,	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
doubt	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
automobile	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
made	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
simpler	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
a	I-ARG
private	I-ARG
car,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
reach	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
destination	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
city	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
sitting	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
vehicle	I-ARG
.	O
Alternatively,	O
if	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
like	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
trip	I-ARG
across	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ocean,	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
plane	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
carry	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
there	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
few	I-ARG
hours,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
hard	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
imagine	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
ancient	I-ARG
times	I-ARG
.	O
Second,	O
technology	B-ARG
also	I-ARG
makes	I-ARG
teaching	I-ARG
simpler	I-ARG
.	O
In	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
past,	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
write	I-ARG
what	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
convey	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
chalkboard,	I-ARG
resulting	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
waste	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
fatigue	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
teachers	I-ARG
.	O
With	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
advent	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
iPads	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
e-learning,	I-ARG
paper	I-ARG
books	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
unnecessary,	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
does	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
blackboards,	I-ARG
it	O
is	O
because	O
all	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
information	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
stored	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
iPads,	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
single	I-ARG
click,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
appear	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
eyes	I-ARG
at	I-ARG
once	I-ARG
.	O
Admittedly,	O
to	O
some	O
extent,	O
technology	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
complicated	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
the	B-ARG
cell	I-ARG
phone,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
used	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
simply	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
tool	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
deliver	I-ARG
messages	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
your	I-ARG
contacts	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
distance,	I-ARG
now	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
playing	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
role	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
just	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
phone	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
communications	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
folks	B-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
check	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
Facebooks,	I-ARG
Twitters,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
Forums	I-ARG
accounts	I-ARG
every	I-ARG
minute,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
add	I-ARG
too	I-ARG
much	I-ARG
pressure	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
games	B-ARG
on	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
phone	I-ARG
exert	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
tremendous	I-ARG
fascination	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

problem	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
got	I-ARG

Consequently,	O

a	I-ARG
valuable	I-ARG

By	B-ARG

the	I-ARG

how	I-ARG

this,	O

Here	O

some	O
reasons	O

examples	O
to	O
illustrate	O
my	O
viewpoint	O

Historic	B-ARG
buildings	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
intrinsic	I-ARG
values,	I-ARG

significant	I-ARG
symbols	I-ARG

By	B-ARG

--	I-ARG
whether	I-ARG
related	I-ARG

something	I-ARG
famous	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
recognizably	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

when	B-ARG
somebody	I-ARG

Beijing,	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

remarkable	I-ARG
sign	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
inevitable	I-ARG
history	I-ARG

the	I-ARG

historic	B-ARG
buildings	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
our	I-ARG

a	I-ARG

can	I-ARG
imitate	I-ARG
this	I-ARG

Overall,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
the	B-ARG

However,	O
the	B-ARG

a	I-ARG
one-way	I-ARG

There	B-ARG

all	B-ARG

pay	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
government,	I-ARG

it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
most	I-ARG
important	I-ARG
source	I-ARG
of	I-ARG

a	B-ARG

national	I-ARG
defence	I-ARG

for	I-ARG

well-being	I-ARG

responsibilities	I-ARG

we	O

impoverished	I-ARG

disabled	I-ARG
people	I-ARG

every	I-ARG
society,	I-ARG
needing	I-ARG
help	I-ARG

support	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
others	I-ARG

It	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
government	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
fund	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
ease	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
difficulties,	I-ARG
but	O
such	B-ARG
financial	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
usually	I-ARG
far	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
enough	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
such	O
case,	O
aids	B-ARG
from	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
capable	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
wealthier	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
particularly	I-ARG
crucial,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
great	I-ARG
complement	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
support	I-ARG

Another	B-ARG
responsibility	I-ARG
all	I-ARG
citizens	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
maintain	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
stability	I-ARG
together	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
police	I-ARG
force	I-ARG

There	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
criminals	I-ARG

the	I-ARG
number	I-ARG

policemen	I-ARG

So	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
quite	I-ARG
necessary	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
residents	I-ARG
to	I-ARG

actions	I-ARG

ensure	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

debates	I-ARG
.	O
There	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
some	B-ARG
behaviors	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tourists	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
welcome	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
area	I-ARG
.	O
Firstly,	O
some	B-ARG
people	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
rubbish	I-ARG
after	I-ARG
visiting	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
attractions	I-ARG
.	O
Therefore,	O
those	B-ARG
local	I-ARG
residents	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
clean	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
frequently	I-ARG
so	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
new	I-ARG
batch	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
tourists	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
tidy	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
neat	I-ARG
environment	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
tourists	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
offend	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
background	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
example,	O
Indians	B-ARG
don't	I-ARG
eat	I-ARG
beef	I-ARG
since	O
they	B-ARG
worship	I-ARG
cows	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
if	B-ARG
tourists	I-ARG
want	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
respect	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
tradition,	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
will	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
beef	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
restaurant	I-ARG
.	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
in	B-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
avoid	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
conflicts	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
foreigners	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
locals,	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
trying	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
different	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
find	I-ARG
solutions	I-ARG
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
tourists	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
given	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
brochures	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
local	I-ARG
traditions	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
customs	I-ARG
before	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
visit	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
place	I-ARG
.	O
Furthermore,	O
the	B-ARG
tour	I-ARG
guide	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
willing	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
tourists	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
understand	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
countries	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
the	B-ARG
possibility	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
conflicts	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
reduced	I-ARG
because	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
understanding	I-ARG
between	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
parties	I-ARG
.	O
Obviously,	O
people	B-ARG
are	I-ARG
looking	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
solution	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
understanding	I-ARG
each	I-ARG
other	I-ARG
while	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
encounter	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
conflicts	I-ARG
caused	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
international	I-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
I	O
think	O
international	B-ARG
tourism	I-ARG
leads	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
both	I-ARG
tension	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
understanding	I-ARG

First	O
of	O
all,	O
traditional	B-ARG

They	B-ARG
make	I-ARG

Consequently,	O

they	B-ARG

a	I-ARG

Futhermore,	O

Personally,	O
I	O
think	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
no	I-ARG
evidence	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
reduction	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
rates	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
death	I-ARG
penalty	I-ARG
because	O
of	O
many	O
reasons	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
capital	B-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
form	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
revenge	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
creates	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
.	O
Crimes	B-ARG
kill	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
illegal;	I-ARG
nevertheless,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
government	I-ARG
use	I-ARG
law	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
punish	I-ARG
them,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
same	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
sinned	I-ARG
but	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
legal	I-ARG
one	I-ARG
.	O
As	O
a	O
fact	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
repeated	I-ARG
second	I-ARG
time;	I-ARG
also,	O
it	B-ARG
is	I-ARG
regarded	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
"legalized	I-ARG
revenge"	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
victims'	I-ARG
family	I-ARG
.	O
Hence,	O
death	B-ARG
penalty	I-ARG
neither	I-ARG
controls	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
society	I-ARG
nor	I-ARG
creates	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
violent	I-ARG
culture	I-ARG
.	O
Secondly,	O
nobody	B-ARG
has	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
another	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
undeniable	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
rights	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
basic	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
vital	I-ARG
rights	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
human	I-ARG
being	I-ARG
.	O
No	B-ARG
one	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
right	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
human;	I-ARG
even	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
he	I-ARG
committed	I-ARG
murder	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
you	I-ARG
kill	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
criminal,	I-ARG
you	I-ARG
become	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
if	B-ARG
we	I-ARG
think	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
killing	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
best	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
solve	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
problem,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
neither	I-ARG
unethical	I-ARG
nor	I-ARG
immoral	I-ARG
.	O
In	O
short,	O
crimes	B-ARG
seem	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
due	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
capital	I-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
.	O
Finally,	O
with	B-ARG
some	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
criminals,	I-ARG
capital	I-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
out	I-ARG
.	O
Criminals	B-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
punished	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
misdeeds	I-ARG
.	O
If	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
kill	I-ARG
someone	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
end	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
life	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
dead	I-ARG
without	I-ARG
paying	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
sins,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
so	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
.	O
They	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
undergo	I-ARG
any	I-ARG
pain	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
misery	I-ARG
.	O
Why	O
do	O
not	O
we	O
have	O
other	O
wisely	O
punishments?	O
As	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
some	B-ARG
industries	I-ARG
such	I-ARG
as	I-ARG
mining,	I-ARG
oil	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
gas	I-ARG
extraction,	I-ARG
reclamation,	I-ARG
etc,	I-ARG
needs	I-ARG
many	I-ARG
labors	I-ARG
.	O
Why	B-ARG
do	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
punish	I-ARG
them	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
doing	I-ARG
something	I-ARG
meaningful	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
country-	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
.	O
Moreover,	O
rehabilitation	B-ARG
and	I-ARG
education	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
also	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
better	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
prevent	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
minimize	I-ARG
offensive	I-ARG
acts	I-ARG
.	O
To	O
conclude,	O
capital	B-ARG
punishment	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
form	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
legalized	I-ARG
revenge,	I-ARG
it	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
an	I-ARG
easy	I-ARG
way	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
serious	I-ARG
crimes,	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
nobody	I-ARG
has	I-ARG
rights	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
take	I-ARG
others	I-ARG
life;	I-ARG
thus,	O
it	B-ARG
neither	I-ARG
demines	I-ARG

essential	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
control	I-ARG
violence	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
society	I-ARG

The	B-ARG

the	I-ARG

To	O
start	O
with,	O
since	O

student	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
been	I-ARG
exposed	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
wide	I-ARG
range	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
information,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
neccessarily	I-ARG
broaden	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
minds	I-ARG
.	O
The	B-ARG
internet,	I-ARG
for	I-ARG
example,	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
knowledge	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG

There,	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
can	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
ascertain	I-ARG

issues	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
discuss	I-ARG

Another	B-ARG
point	I-ARG
that	I-ARG
students	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
benefit	I-ARG
from	I-ARG
technology	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
shortened	I-ARG
time	I-ARG
for	I-ARG

The	B-ARG
modern	I-ARG

In	B-ARG

Detailed	B-ARG
description	O
of	O

society	O

detailed	O
reports	O
about	O

Personally,	O
I	O
believe	O
such	B-ARG
details	I-ARG
should	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
strictly	I-ARG
censored,	I-ARG
if	I-ARG
not	I-ARG
banned	I-ARG
altogether	I-ARG
.	O
It	O
is	O
widely	O
known	O
that	O
the	B-ARG
press	I-ARG
provide	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
public	I-ARG
with	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
content	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
order	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
increase	I-ARG
newspaper	I-ARG
circulation	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
rating	I-ARG
.	O
These	B-ARG
days	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
primary	I-ARG
purpose	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
journalists	I-ARG
covering	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
details	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
acts	I-ARG
is,	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
often	I-ARG
than	I-ARG
that,	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
boost	I-ARG
newspaper	I-ARG
circulations	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
TV	I-ARG
ratings	I-ARG
.	O
Consequently,	O
a	B-ARG
great	I-ARG
deal	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
coverage	I-ARG
is	I-ARG
rather	I-ARG
biased,	I-ARG
exaggerated	I-ARG
or	I-ARG
fraudulent,	I-ARG
which	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
result	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
terrorize	I-ARG
communities	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
leave	I-ARG
law-aiding	I-ARG
people	I-ARG
increasingly	I-ARG
apprehensive	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
about	I-ARG
crimes	I-ARG
.	O
An	O
even	O
more	O
detrimental	O
fact	O
is	O
that	O
detailed	O
reports	O
of	O
crimes	O
exposured	O
on	O
the	O
press	O
may	O
provide	O
the	O
potential	O
criminals	O
with	O
instructive	O
learning	O
materials,	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
hard	O
to	O
obtain	O
otherwise	O
.	O
This	B-ARG
may	I-ARG
help	I-ARG
those	I-ARG
who	I-ARG
are	I-ARG
in	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
process	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
panning	I-ARG
a	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
act	I-ARG
perfect	I-ARG
their	I-ARG
plans,	I-ARG
avoid	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
pitfalls	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
make	I-ARG
themselves	I-ARG
harder	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
tracked	I-ARG
down	I-ARG
by	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
police	I-ARG
.	O
Thus,	O
without	B-ARG
the	I-ARG
prevention	I-ARG
on	I-ARG
criminal	I-ARG
details,	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
unlawful	I-ARG
behavior	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
more	I-ARG
severe	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
social	I-ARG
harmony	I-ARG
would	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
broken	I-ARG
.	O
Most	O
importantly,	O
particular	B-ARG
coverage	I-ARG
of	I-ARG
heinous	I-ARG
crimes	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
further	I-ARG
traumatize	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
victims	I-ARG

crimes	I-ARG
because	O
they	B-ARG
have	I-ARG

what	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
have	I-ARG
experienced	I-ARG

Without	B-ARG
their	I-ARG
consent,	I-ARG
this	I-ARG
could	I-ARG
only	I-ARG
add	I-ARG
to	I-ARG
theses	I-ARG
innocent	I-ARG
people's	I-ARG
mental	I-ARG
suffering	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
they	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
do	I-ARG
some	I-ARG
extreme	I-ARG
actions	I-ARG

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
strongly	O
hold	O
my	O
point	O
that	O
any	B-ARG
descriptions	I-ARG

not	I-ARG
go	I-ARG
unchecked	I-ARG

any	I-ARG
longer,	I-ARG
as	B-ARG
they	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
be	I-ARG
false,	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
further	I-ARG
drive	I-ARG
up	I-ARG
the	I-ARG
already-high	I-ARG
crime	I-ARG
rate	I-ARG
and	I-ARG
may	I-ARG
bring	I-ARG
even	I-ARG

I	O
