the	O

While	O
some	O
might	O
think	O
the	O
tourism	O
bring	O
large	O
profit	O
for	O
the	O
destination	O
countries,	O
I	O
would	O
contend	O
that	O
this	Arg_B
industry	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
affected	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I
attributes	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
damaged	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
natural	Arg_I
environment	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
tourist	Arg_I
destinations	Arg_I
.	O
Firstly,	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
undeniable	O
fact	O
that	O
tourists	Arg_B
from	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
cultures	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
probably	Arg_I
cause	Arg_I
changes	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I
identity	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
tourist	Arg_I
destinations	Arg_I
.	O
Take	Arg_B
Thailand	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
example,	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
Vietnam	Arg_I
War,	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
American	Arg_I
soldiers	Arg_I
came	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
Thailand	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
break	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
involved	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
sexual	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
drug	Arg_I
activities,	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
huge	Arg_I
demands	Arg_I
caused	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
local	Arg_I
businesses	Arg_I
opened	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
expanded,	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
illegally	Arg_I
involved	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
under-age	Arg_I
prostitutes	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
maximize	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
profits	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
was	Arg_I
due	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
lack	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
adequate	Arg_I
controls	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
authorities	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
lead	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
bad	Arg_I
image	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
Thailand	Arg_I
tourism	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore	O
this	O
proves	O
that	O
international	Arg_B
tourism	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
negative	Arg_I
impacts	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
destination	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
there	O
are	O
clear	O
evidences	O
that	O
tourism	Arg_B
increasingly	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
harms	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
natural	Arg_I
habitats	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
destination	Arg_I
appeals	Arg_I
.	O
As	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
Australia’s	Arg_I
Great	Arg_I
Barrier	Arg_I
Reef	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
shown,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
billion	Arg_I
visitors	Arg_I
per	Arg_I
annum	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
generated	Arg_I
immense	Arg_I
destruction	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
nature	Arg_I
wonder,	Arg_I
namely	Arg_I
breaking	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
corals	Arg_I
caused	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
walking	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
throwing	Arg_I
boat’s	Arg_I
anchors,	Arg_I
dropping	Arg_I

other	Arg_I
sorts	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
pollutions	Arg_I

For	O
this	O
reason,	O
many	Arg_B
marine	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
endangered,	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

uninhabitable	Arg_I

these	Arg_I

Thus,	O
it	O
is	O
apparent	O
that	O
tourism	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
threatened	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
nature	Arg_I
environments	Arg_I

To	O
conclude,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
tourism	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
created	Arg_I
threatening	Arg_I
pressure	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
both	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

If	O

take	O

appropriately	O
conserve	O
these	O

they	O

Living	O

It	O
is	O
every	O
student's	O
desire	O
to	O
study	O

a	O
good	O

a	O

While	O
some	O
students	O
study	O

live	O
overseas	O
to	O
achieve	O
this,	O
some	O

to	O
study	O
home	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
difficulties	O
of	O
living	O
and	O
studying	O
overseas	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
one	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
studies	Arg_I
overseas	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
gain	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
throughout	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
experience	Arg_I
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
First,	O
studying	Arg_B
at	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
overseas	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
gives	Arg_I
individuals	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
opportunity	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
social	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
interacting	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
communicating	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
origins	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
cultures	Arg_I
.	O
Compared	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
peers	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
country,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
likely	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
overseas	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
successful	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
adapting	Arg_I
himself/herself	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
environments	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
situations	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
living	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
overseas	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
irreplaceable	Arg_I
experience	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
comes	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
standing	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
feet	Arg_I
.	O
One	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
overseas	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
struggle	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
loneliness,	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
away	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
but	O
those	Arg_B
difficulties	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
turn	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
experiences	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
following	Arg_I
steps	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
the	Arg_B
one	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
depending	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
anyone	Arg_I
else	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
employers	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
mostly	Arg_I
looking	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
international	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
.	O
Becoming	Arg_B
successful	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
student	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
edge	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
market	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
one	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
studied	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
lived	Arg_I
overseas	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
eligible	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
job	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
his/her	Arg_I
peers	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
there	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
difficulties	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
student	Arg_I
might	Arg_I
face	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
overseas	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
living	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
overseas	Arg_I
gives	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
individual	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
perspective	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
subject	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
studied	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
general	Arg_I
life	Arg_I

many	Arg_I
advantages	Arg_I

Students	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

First	O
of	O
all,	O
students	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
outside	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
country	Arg_I

Living	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

country	Arg_I
requires	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
flexibility	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
adaptability	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
one's	Arg_I
character	Arg_I
.	O
For	O

students	Arg_B
might	Arg_I
face	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
challenges	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
host	Arg_I
country	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
they	Arg_B

Overcoming	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
mature	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
self-independence	Arg_I
.	O
One	O
other	O
important	O
factor	O
is	O
the	Arg_B
new	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I

that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

they	Arg_B

a	Arg_I

educational	Arg_I

experience	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

Most	Arg_B
important	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
cultural	Arg_I
aspect	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
experience	Arg_I
.	O
While	Arg_B
living	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

country,	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

Learning	Arg_B

it	O
is	O
generally	O

that	O
advertising	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
carried	Arg_I
out	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
main	Arg_I
purpose	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
promoting	Arg_I
different	Arg_I

or	Arg_I
encouraging	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
consume	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
.	O
Advertisements	Arg_B
are,	Arg_I
therefore,	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
businesses	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
sales	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
hence	Arg_I
profits	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
to	Arg_B
consumers,	Arg_I
advertising	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
bring	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
benefits	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
customers	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
telecommunication	Arg_I
services	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
idea	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
current	Arg_I
offers	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
companies	Arg_I
and	O
hence	O
they	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
compare	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
decision	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
choosing	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
internet	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
mobile	Arg_I
phone	Arg_I
plans	Arg_I
.	O
From	O
all	O
of	O
these,	O
it	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
see	O
why	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
advertising	O
is	O
a	O
positive	O
part	O
of	O
life	O
will	O
garner	O
strong	O
support	O

However,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
seen	O
that	O
some	O
people	O
have	O
argued	O
against	O
advertising	O
due	O
to	O
its	O
negative	O
impacts	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
a	Arg_B
huge	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
advertisements	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
sent	Arg_I
automatically	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
system	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
personal	Arg_I
phones	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
email	Arg_I
addresses,	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
generally	Arg_I
known	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
spam,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
causes	Arg_I
discomfort	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
annoyance	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
advertising	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
expensive	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
advertising	Arg_I
campaign	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
done	Arg_I
successfully	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
brings	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
results	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
advertising	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
believed	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
many,	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
financial	Arg_I
burden	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
businesses	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
after	O
analyzing	O
the	O
pros	O
and	O
cons	O
of	O
advertising,	O
both	O
of	O
the	O
views	O
have	O
strong	O
support,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
felt	O
that	O
more	Arg_B
good	Arg_I
comes	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
advertising	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
bad	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
the	Arg_B
idea	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
advertising	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
positive	Arg_I
part	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
more	Arg_I

It	O
is	O

them	O

From	O
my	O
point	O

big	Arg_B
cities	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
place	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
bringing	Arg_I
up	Arg_I

To	O
begin	O
with,	O
it	O
is	O
undeniable	O
that	O
education	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
big	Arg_I
cities	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

with	Arg_I
countrysides	Arg_I

For	O

in	Arg_B
my	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I

a	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

role	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

of	Arg_I
vital	Arg_I
significance	Arg_I

It	O

true	O
if	O
we	O
consider	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
a	Arg_B
single	Arg_I
international	Arg_I

plays	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

role	Arg_I

As	Arg_B

have	Arg_I
access	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
communicate	Arg_I

each	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
efficiently	Arg_I

In	O

without	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
a	Arg_B

serves	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
economic	Arg_I
purpose	Arg_I

a	Arg_B

erode	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

some	O

some	Arg_B

view,	O
the	Arg_B
benefits	Arg_I

of	O
all,	O
children	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

When	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
kind	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
paid	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
looking	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
babies,	Arg_I
doing	Arg_I
housework	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
keeping	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
some	Arg_I

many	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
they	Arg_B

understand	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

whether	Arg_B

To	Arg_B

keep	Arg_I
an	Arg_I

take	Arg_I

Furthermore,	O

a	Arg_I

For	O

a	Arg_B

with	Arg_I

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	Arg_B

Thus,	O
I	Arg_B

Thus,	O
what	Arg_B

a	Arg_I

every	Arg_B

it,	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
age	Arg_I

.	O
From	Arg_B
social	Arg_I
perspective,	Arg_I
massively	Arg_I

For	O

sufficient	Arg_B
pension	Arg_I

even	O
though	O
the	O

it	O

have	Arg_I
one	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

We	O
can	O
not	O
deny	O
that	O
being	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
someone	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
acquaintant	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
it's	Arg_B
not	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
anyone	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
believe	O
friends	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
compatibility	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
.	O
After	Arg_B
two	Arg_I
years	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
college	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
found	Arg_I
sometimes	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
differences	Arg_I
between	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
similarities,	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
growing	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
families	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
educated	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
various	Arg_I
ways	Arg_I
.	O
Sometimes	Arg_B
acquaintances	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
acquaintances	Arg_I
.	O
We	Arg_B
spend	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
together	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
never	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
.	O
So,	O
it's	Arg_B
much	Arg_I
easier	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
casual	Arg_I
acquaintances	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
close	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I

Second,	O
close	Arg_B
friends	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
easily	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
others	Arg_I
feelings	Arg_I

Because	O
of	O
the	O
similarity	O
I	O
talked	O
before,	O
acquaintances	Arg_B
probably	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
they	Arg_B
wouldn't	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
spare	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
consider	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
feelings	Arg_I
.	O
Everyone	Arg_B
play	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
role	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
acquaintance	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
time	Arg_I

Being	Arg_B
friendly	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
treat	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
acquaintance	Arg_I

way	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
enough	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I

When	Arg_B
my	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
sick,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
ask	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
okay	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
acquaintance	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
soon	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
possible	Arg_I

If	Arg_B
my	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
wrong	Arg_I
direction	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
life	Arg_I

I	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
try	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
pull	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
back,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
stand	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
stare	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
it's	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
business	Arg_I

I	O

The	O
first	O
and	O
foremost	O
reason	O
lies	O
in	O
the	O
inevitable	O
fact	O
that	O
we	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
save	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
accomplishing	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
tasks,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
fitting	Arg_I
example	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
found	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
experience	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
missing	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
just	Arg_I
failed	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
participate	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
entrance	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I
because	O
I	Arg_B
thought	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
enough	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
eating	Arg_I
breakfast	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
transporting	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

while	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
stocked	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
traffic	Arg_I
jam	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
missed	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
first	Arg_I
test	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
we	O
can	O
start	O
to	O
agree	O
that	O
we	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
eager	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
our	Arg_I

getting	Arg_I
lazy	Arg_I

If	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
avoid	Arg_I
being	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
sluggish	Arg_I
person,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

probability	Arg_I
of	Arg_I

my	Arg_I

successfully	Arg_I

For	O

I	Arg_B
had	Arg_I
spent	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
practicing	Arg_I

that	Arg_I

Hence,	O
from	O
this	O

we	O

that	O
keeping	Arg_B

some	O

If	Arg_B

living	Arg_B

one	Arg_B

they	Arg_I

Accordingly,	O
spending	Arg_B

an	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

There	Arg_B

many	Arg_I

the	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

the	Arg_B

Where	O

a	O

I	O
firmly	O
believe	O
that	O
people	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
it	Arg_I

spoken	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
deeper	Arg_I
understanding	Arg_I

different	Arg_I

those	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

own	Arg_I
countries	Arg_I

Person	Arg_B
'A'	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
learns	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
non-native	Arg_I
language	Arg_I

his	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
receive	Arg_I
benefit	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
step-by-step	Arg_I
teaching	Arg_I
method	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
he	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
jumping	Arg_I
into	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
country	Arg_I

Therefore	O
he	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
set	Arg_I
aside	Arg_I
enough	Arg_I
time	Arg_I

energy	Arg_I
dedicated	Arg_I

learning	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

Besides,	O
all	O
the	O
learners	O
are	O
probably	O
from	O
the	O
same	O
country,	O
so	O
all	Arg_B
these	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
likely	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
learned	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
language,	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
less,	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
way	Arg_I

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand,	O
when	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
learner	Arg_I
wants	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
spoken,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
opportunity	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
communicate	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
natives	Arg_I
.	O
He	Arg_B
may	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
native	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
participate	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
groups	Arg_I
where	Arg_I
members	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
foreign	Arg_I
country	Arg_I
.	O
No	O
doubt,	O
it	Arg_B
leads	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
understanding	Arg_I

essential	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I

He	Arg_B
also	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
access	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
up-to-date	Arg_I
language	Arg_I

Thus	O
he	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
useful	Arg_I

so	Arg_I
many	Arg_I

Yet,	O
I	Arg_B
prefer	Arg_I

individually	Arg_I

it	Arg_B

it	Arg_I
helps	Arg_I
me	Arg_I

Studying	Arg_B

helps	Arg_I
us	Arg_I

focus	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
lessons	Arg_I

For	O

I	Arg_B
am	Arg_I

comprehend	Arg_I
my	Arg_I

I	Arg_I

I	Arg_B

prepare	Arg_I

go	Arg_I
over	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
all	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
we	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

us	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
sit	Arg_I

study	Arg_I

math,	Arg_I

In	O
my	O

I	Arg_B

every	Arg_I
minute	Arg_I
without	Arg_I

For	O

In	O
fact,	O
I	Arg_B
agree	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
idea	Arg_I

Some	O
important	O
characteristics	O
of	O
a	O
co-worker	O
At	O
work,	O
you	O
meet	O
people	O

diverse	O

you	O
are	O
required	O
to	O
maintain	O

many	O
of	O
them	O
in	O

a	O

However,	O
the	O
relationship	O
you	O
need	O

maintain	O
with	O
your	O
co-worker	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
one	O
since	O
he	O
or	O
she	O

the	O
person	O
who	O

very	O
closely	O

you,	O

in	O
most	O

you	O
have	O

him	O
or	O
her	O

Therefore	O
in	O
my	O
view,	O
a	Arg_B
good	Arg_I
co-worker	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
three	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
characteristics	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
cooperation,	Arg_I
trustworthiness,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
fellowship	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
co-workers	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
cooperative	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
another	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
cooperate,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
lots	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
disputes	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
once	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
co-worker	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
family	Arg_I
conscious	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore	O
he	Arg_B
always	Arg_I
left	Arg_I
office	Arg_I
sharp	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
without	Arg_I
giving	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
consideration	Arg_I
whether	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
finished	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
.	O
Most	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
time,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
order	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
protect	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
getting	Arg_I
caught	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
supervisor	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
authoritative	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
one	Arg_B
day	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
wanted	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
off	Arg_I
early	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
mother	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
doctor	Arg_I
.	O
When	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
requested	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
co-worker	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
helping	Arg_I
hand	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
finish	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
early,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
turned	Arg_I
down	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
request	Arg_I
giving	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
silly	Arg_I
excuse	Arg_I
.	O
From	Arg_B
that	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
onwards	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
did	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
offer	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
support	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
finally	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
transferred	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
department	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
distant	Arg_I
location	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
punishment	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
irresponsibility	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
I	O
believe	O
if	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
co-workers	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
corporate	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
devastating	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
environment	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
co-workers	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
trust	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
act	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
suspicion	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
aspect	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
environment	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
came	Arg_I
across	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
situation	Arg_I
once	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
subordinates	Arg_I
used	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
suspect	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
co-worker	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
carrying	Arg_I
tales	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
.	O
To	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
certain	Arg_I
extent	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
suspicion	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
valid	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
co-worker	Arg_I
made	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
attempts	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
highlight	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
drawbacks	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
.	O
However	O
I	Arg_B
never	Arg_I
encourage	Arg_I
tale	Arg_I
carriers	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
principle	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
therefore	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
co-worker	Arg_I
gave	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
talking	Arg_I
ill	Arg_I
against	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
.	O
But	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
mistrust	Arg_I
continued	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
created	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
unpleasant	Arg_I
situations	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
everybody	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
department	Arg_I
.	O
Finally,	O
the	Arg_B
co-workers	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
believe	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
fellowship	Arg_I
.	O
This	Arg_B
helps	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
enjoy	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
while	Arg_I
building	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
strong	Arg_I
personal	Arg_I
relationships	Arg_I

After	O
all,	O
you	Arg_B
spend	Arg_I
most	Arg_I

your	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
at	Arg_I

whether	O

Although,	O
online	O

have	O
many	O
advantages,	O
for	O
me,	O
I	Arg_B
prefer	Arg_I
traditional	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
for	O
several	O
reasons	O
.	O
First,	O
the	Arg_B
participant	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
others	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
classmates	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
professors	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
factor	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
.	O
Working	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
leads	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
discussion	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
opinion	Arg_I
among	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
.	O
Consequently,	O
the	Arg_B
discussion	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
results	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
expanded	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
vision	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
respect	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
others	Arg_I
roommate's	Arg_I
ideas	Arg_I
.	O
Unlike	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
distance	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
few	Arg_I
opportunities	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
discuss	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
classroom	Arg_B
learning	Arg_I
provides	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
studying	Arg_I
.	O
During	Arg_B
student's	Arg_I
free	Arg_I
time,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
join,	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
playing	Arg_I
sports,	Arg_I
going	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
lab,	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
going	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
library	Arg_I
.	O
These	Arg_B
activities	Arg_I
lead	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
interact	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
.	O
Connection	O
with	O
friends	O
improves	O
their	O
IQ	O
abilities,	O
furthermore,	O
they	Arg_B
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
societies	Arg_I
.	O
While	O
the	Arg_B
online	Arg_I
course	Arg_I
keeps	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
.	O
Lastly,	O
in	Arg_B
school,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
professors	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
guided	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
during	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
problem	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
needed	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
advice	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
professor	Arg_I
provides	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
answers	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
mind	Arg_I
helping	Arg_I
you,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
never	Arg_I
leave	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
alone	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
got	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
problem	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
contrast,	O
in	Arg_B
distance	Arg_I
learning,	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
aspects	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
professor	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
reduced	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
professor	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
assigned	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
teach	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
there	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
long	Arg_I
response	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
ask	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
question	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
traditional	Arg_B
learning	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
benefits	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
.	O
But	O
in	O
the	O
future,	O
it	O

While	O
some	O

that	O
non-academic	Arg_B

be	Arg_I
completely	Arg_I
removed,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
strongly	Arg_I
disagree	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
that	Arg_I

To	O
begin	O

from	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
health	Arg_I

If	Arg_B

For	O

after	Arg_B

sitting	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
classroom	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
whole	Arg_I

it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
for	Arg_I

to	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
outdoor	Arg_I
activities,	Arg_I
such	Arg_I

improve	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
ability	Arg_I
during	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
afternoon	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
.	O
Removing	Arg_B
physical	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
from	Arg_I

only	Arg_I
be	Arg_I

success	Arg_I

Success	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
ultimate	Arg_I
goal	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
student,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
requires	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I
knowledge,	Arg_I

also	Arg_I
practical	Arg_I
life	Arg_I

Thus,	O

only	Arg_I
focus	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

it	Arg_B

Some	O

argue	O
that	O

learn	Arg_I
practical	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
after	Arg_I

However,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
it	Arg_B

not	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
idea	Arg_I
because	O
most	Arg_B

rather	Arg_I
watch	Arg_I

play	Arg_I

after	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
instead	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
parents	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
usually	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
busy	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
daily	Arg_I
jobs	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
teach	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

In	O
conclusion,	O
I	O
strongly	O
believe	O
that	O
non-academic	Arg_B

childhood	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
person's	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
in	Arg_B
childhood	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
happier	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
adulthood	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
worry	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
bills,	Arg_I

how	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
just	Arg_I
worry	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
two	Arg_I
things:	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
fun,	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
.	O
A	Arg_B
child's	Arg_I
daily	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
school,	Arg_I
playing	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
sleeping	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
when	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
came	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
took	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
bike	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
soccer	Arg_I
ball	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
play	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
neighborhood	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
I	Arg_B
did	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
worry	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
costs	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
things,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
fun	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
learned	Arg_I
.	O
Also,	O
people	O
are	O
most	O
creative	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
children,	O
children	Arg_B
imagine	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
games	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
fun	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
happy	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
childhood	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
period	Arg_I
where	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
school	Arg_B
memories	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
memories	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
person's	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
There	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
learn,	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
find	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
first	Arg_I
love,	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
long-lasting	Arg_I
friendships	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
of-course	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
fun	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
my	Arg_B
father's	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
moments	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
years	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
he	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
in-touch	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
classmates	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
sometimes	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
together	Arg_I

share	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
childhood	Arg_I
memories	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
other	O
words,	O
childhood	Arg_B
is,	Arg_I
indeed,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
happiest	Arg_I
moments	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
person's	Arg_I
life	Arg_I

how	O
early	O
the	O

a	O
difficult	O
issue	O

In	O
my	O
point	O
of	O
view,	O
staying	Arg_B
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
longer	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
does	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
benefits	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
disadvantages	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
.	O
My	O
opinion	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
creating	O
memories	O
with	O
parents,	O
saving	O
money,	O
and	O
taking	O
advice	O
from	O
parents	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
significant	O
upsides	O
is	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
young	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
experience	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
.	O
The	Arg_B
young	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
try	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
create	Arg_I
memories	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
dad	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
mom	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
early	Arg_I
age	Arg_I
.	O
When	Arg_B
having	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
job,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
low	Arg_I
possibilities	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
hometown	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
he	Arg_I
lives	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
longer	Arg_I
time,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
chances	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
share	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
feelings,	Arg_I
exercise,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
travel	Arg_I
together	Arg_I
.	O
All	Arg_B
memories	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
priceless	Arg_I
treasure	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
passes	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
I	O
think	O
undergoing	Arg_B
with	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
worthwhile	Arg_I
.	O
Furthermore,	O
living	Arg_B
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
costs	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
living	Arg_I
outside	Arg_I
.	O
Learning	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
independent	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
leave	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
he	Arg_B
may	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
rent	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
house	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
rental	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
burden	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
another	Arg_B
daily	Arg_I
expense	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
considerable	Arg_I
outgoings	Arg_I
.	O
Spending	Arg_B
much	Arg_I
money	Arg_I
may	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
result	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
expect	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
a	O
word,	O
the	Arg_B
parents	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
save	Arg_I
money,	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
live	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
longer	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
third	O
convincing	O
reason	O
is	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
young	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I
father	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
mother's	Arg_I
suggestions	Arg_I
.	O
When	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
dilemma,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
comfort	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
big	Arg_I
hand	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
most	Arg_I
familiar	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
suitable	Arg_I
advice	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
lead	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
immediately,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
suffer	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
pain	Arg_I
.	O
Hence,	O
taking	Arg_B
advice	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
parents,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
adult	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
through	Arg_I
obstacles	Arg_I
easily	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
living	Arg_B
with	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
longer	Arg_I
brings	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
memories	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
parents,	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
cost,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
advice	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
parents	Arg_I
.	O
Hence,	O
staying	Arg_B

the	Arg_B

it	Arg_B

a	Arg_I

First	O
of	O
all,	O
the	Arg_B
zoo	Arg_I
gives	Arg_I

When	O
you	O

Inevitably,	O
the	Arg_B
zoo	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
place	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
innate	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
zoo	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
let	Arg_I

have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
biology	Arg_I
practically	Arg_I

They	Arg_B
are	Arg_I

observe	Arg_I
animals'	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
practical	Arg_B

help	Arg_I

relax	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
boring	Arg_I
lecture	Arg_I

.	O
Besides,	O
researchers	Arg_B
need	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
zoo	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
pick	Arg_I
up	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
examples	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
animals	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
researches	Arg_I
because	O
it	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
diverse	Arg_I
species	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
animals	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
the	Arg_B
zoo	Arg_I
preserves	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
large	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
rare	Arg_I
animals	Arg_I

provides	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
safe	Arg_I
habitats	Arg_I

In	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

They,	Arg_B

Furthermore,	O
we	Arg_B

Last	O

because	Arg_B

beautiful	Arg_I
animals	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
tourist	Arg_I

There	Arg_B

If	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
large	Arg_I
number	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
both	Arg_I
national	Arg_I

it	Arg_I
will	Arg_I

That	Arg_B

In	O
conclusion,	O
the	Arg_B

not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
saves	Arg_I
animals	Arg_I

danger	Arg_I

In	Arg_B

In	Arg_B

In	O

First	O
of	O
all,	O
a	Arg_B
mistake	Arg_I
does	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
last	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
long	Arg_I

a	Arg_I

Anybody	Arg_B

If	Arg_B
someone	Arg_I

mistake,	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
she	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
closed	Arg_I
mind	Arg_I

I	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
mistakes	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
forgotten	Arg_I
quickly	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
my	Arg_B
friend	Arg_I
Lee	Arg_I
made	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
mistake	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
broke	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
precious	Arg_I
gift	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
I	Arg_B
forgot	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
two	Arg_I
days,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
felt	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
peace	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
.	O
Some	O
people	O
might	O
say	O
I	O
am	O
silly,	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
mistake	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
forgettable	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
friendship	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
Everybody	Arg_B
makes	Arg_I
mistake	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
if	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
end	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
friendship	Arg_I
whenever	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
mistake,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
around	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
agree	O
if	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
big	Arg_I
mistake,	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
end	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
friendship	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
when	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
mistake	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
made	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
big	Arg_I
problem,	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
forgive	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
because	O
a	Arg_B
friend	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
gift	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
According	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
research,	Arg_I
85%	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
answered	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
gift	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
a	Arg_B
mistake	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
brake	Arg_I
friendship	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
big	Arg_I

Students	O
should	O
be	O
required	O
to	O
take	O
regular	O
standardized	O
tests	O
The	O
issue	O
at	O
hand	O
is	O
if	O
the	O
schools	O
should	O
require	O
students	O
to	O
take	O
regular	O
standardized	O
exams	O
.	O
This	O
issue	O
is	O
important	O
because	O
nowadays	O
many	O
people	O
cast	O
doubt	O
on	O
it	O
.	O
However,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
standardized	Arg_B
tests	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
option	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
educational	Arg_I
system	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
long	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
really	Arg_I
getting	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
.	O
Firstly,	O
standardized	Arg_B
tests	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
preferable	Arg_I
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
they	Arg_B
help	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
fairly	Arg_I
grade	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example	O
some	Arg_B
students	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
active	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
lessons,	Arg_I
cause	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
already	Arg_I
familiar	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
issue	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
exams	Arg_B
could	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
see	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
real	Arg_I
abilities	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
many	O
teachers	O
rely	O
only	O
on	O
the	O
exam	O
results	O
while	O
grading	O
the	O
class,	O
so	O
the	Arg_B
usage	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
standardized	Arg_I
tests	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
superior	Arg_I
option	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
Additionally,	O
standardized	Arg_B
tests	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
apply	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
practice	Arg_I
.	O
Since,	O
some	O
students	O
may	O
get	O
used	O
to	O
simply	O
rewriting	O
solved	O
problems	O
from	O
the	O
blackboard,	O
so	O
they	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
never	Arg_I
try	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
solve	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
standardized	Arg_B
tests	Arg_I
offer	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
.	O
Thus,	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
schools	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
require	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
standardized	Arg_I
tests,	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
long	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
option	Arg_I
helps	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
both	Arg_I
sides	Arg_I
.	O
Finally,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
requirement	O
to	O
take	O
standardized	O
tests	O
is	O
the	O
right	O
choice,	O
since	O
in	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
case	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
compare	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
level	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
knowledge	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
any	Arg_I
class	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
show	Arg_I
low	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I
performance,	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
teachers	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
intensively	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
support	O
the	O
points	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
say	O
that	O
standardized	Arg_B
tests	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
required	Arg_I
over	Arg_I
those	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
don’t	Arg_I
because	O
if	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
teacher	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
level	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
student	Arg_I
he	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
fairly	Arg_I
share	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
all	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
Ultimately	O
I	O
feel	O
that	O
schools	Arg_B
which	Arg_I
obligate	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
standardized	Arg_I
tests	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
belive	O
this,	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
these	Arg_B
schools	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
qualitatively	Arg_I
check	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
they	Arg_I

giving	Arg_I
an	Arg_I

Life	O

life	O

the	O

As	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
concerned,	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
statement	O
that	O
life	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
city	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
countryside	Arg_I
.	O
Firstly,	O
in	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
city	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
education	Arg_I
system	Arg_I
.	O
This	O
means,	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
schools	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
universities	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
equipped	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
famous	Arg_I
professors	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
places	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
city	Arg_B
provides	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
opportunities	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
countryside	Arg_I
.	O
There	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
jobs,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
well-paid	Arg_I
.	O
Of	O
course	O
living	O
in	O
a	O
city	O
is	O
more	O
expensive,	O
but	O
incomes	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
higher	Arg_I
too	O
.	O
Moreover,	O
in	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
urban	Arg_I
areas	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
citizens	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
means,	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
diversity	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
huge	Arg_I
.	O
Meeting	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
knowing	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
people's	Arg_I
tradition	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
unforgettable	Arg_I
experience,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
influence	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
one's	Arg_I
previous	Arg_I
habits	Arg_I
.	O
Furthermore,	O
the	Arg_B
city	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
well-organised	Arg_I
lines	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
transport	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
buses	O
and	O
trains	O
are	O
more	O
frequent	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
countryside,	O
so	O
the	Arg_B
city	Arg_I
provides	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
communication	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
in	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
countryside	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
places	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
rest,	Arg_I
because	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
its	Arg_I
location	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
peaceful	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
close	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
nature	Arg_I
areas	Arg_I

sadness	Arg_I
.	O
Taking	O
all	O
into	O
account,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
is	O
much	O
better	O
nowadays,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
opportunities	O

the	O

However,	O
I	Arg_B
prefer	Arg_I
e-mail	Arg_I
due	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
3	Arg_I
reasons:	Arg_I
convenience,	Arg_I
honest	Arg_I
expression	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
fluency	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
communicating	Arg_I
.	O
Everyone	O

that	O
e-mail	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
communication	Arg_I
.	O
You	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
talk	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
others	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
thousands	Arg_I
mile	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
if	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
Vietnam	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
another	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
US	Arg_I
-	Arg_I
half	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
Earth,	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
matter	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
far	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
is,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
contact	Arg_I
.	O
We	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
never	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
worry	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
mails	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
sent	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
address	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
address	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
wrong,	Arg_I
then	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
know	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
away	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
e-mail	Arg_B
doesn't	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
time:	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
click	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
writing	Arg_B
e-mail	Arg_I
helps	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
express	Arg_I
honestly	Arg_I
.	O
Some	O
people	O
think	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
face-to-face	Arg_I
conversations	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
stupid	Arg_I
.	O
Sometimes,	Arg_B
their	Arg_I
ideas	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
expressed	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
exactly	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
expect	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
instance,	O
I	Arg_B
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
talk	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
friend	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
ticklish	Arg_I
problem	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
behavior,	Arg_I
it's	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
face	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
explain	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
she	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
do	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
e-mail	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
tool	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
speak	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
.	O
She	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
read	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
e-mail	Arg_I
instead	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
listening	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
voice	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
annoyed	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
don't	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
worry	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
thing	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
opinion	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
unpersuasive	Arg_I
.	O
Last	O
but	O
not	O
least,	O
every	Arg_B
communication	Arg_I
needs	Arg_I
fluency	Arg_I
so	O
people	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
exactly	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
remember	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
long	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
.	O
Voice	Arg_B
email	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
face-to-face	Arg_I

sometimes	Arg_I
make	Arg_I

people	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
confident	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
when	Arg_B
I	Arg_I
face	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
parents,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
can't	Arg_I
speak	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
idea	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
express	Arg_I
consecutively	Arg_I

They	Arg_B
may	Arg_I
stop	Arg_I
me,	Arg_I
speak	Arg_I
something	Arg_I
against	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
forget	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
want	Arg_I

Anyone	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
meet	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
problem	Arg_I
once	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
conversation	Arg_I

E-mail	Arg_B

me	Arg_I
arrange	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
idea	Arg_I
perfectly	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
persuasive	Arg_I

On	O
the	O
whole,	O
to	O
compare	O

all	O
ways	O

I	O
really	O

that	O
e-mail	Arg_B

the	Arg_I
greatest	Arg_I

Communicating	O

and	O
face-to	O

Although	O
many	O
people	O
prefer	O
communicating	O
by	O
telephone	O
or	O
face-to-face,	O
personally	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
communicating	Arg_B
by	Arg_I
e-mails	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
voice	Arg_I
mails	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
.	O
There	O
are	O
several	O
reasons	O
to	O
support	O
this	O
idea	O
which	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
mention	O
in	O
this	O
essay	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
communicating	Arg_B
by	Arg_I
e-mail	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
easy	Arg_I
.	O
Many	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
calling	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
acquainted	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
this	Arg_I
case	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
difficult	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
write	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
e-mail	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
leave	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
voice	Arg_I
mail	Arg_I
because	O
even	Arg_B
shy	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
themselves	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
confident	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
you	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
write	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
e-mail	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
for	O
me,	O
I	Arg_B
work	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
university	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
don't	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
spare	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
during	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
get	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
midnight	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
answer	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
questions	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
solve	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
routine	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
might	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
call	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
meet	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
her	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
appropriate	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
so	O
for	Arg_B
me	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
leave	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
voice	Arg_I
mail	Arg_I
.	O
Thirdly,	O
when	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
write	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
e-mail	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
enough	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
carefully	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
what	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
writing	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
express	Arg_I
yourself	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
you	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
change	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
word	Arg_I
order	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
choose	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
appropriate	Arg_I
style	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
sound	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
polite	Arg_I
.	O
When	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
speak	Arg_I
face-to-face	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
able	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
control	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
word	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
write	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
e-mail	Arg_I
.	O
And	O
finally,	O
there	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
disturb	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
sending	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
e-mail	Arg_I
.	O
You	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
worry	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
interrupting	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
conversation	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
business	Arg_I
.	O
To	O
sum	O
up,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
for	O
me	O
both	O
options	O
of	O
communicating	O
are	O
possible,	O
but	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
an	O
important	O
and	O
not	O
urgent	O
question	O
I	Arg_B
would	Arg_I
prefer	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
answer	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
means	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
internet	Arg_I
or	Arg_I

Should	O
we	O

Every	O
parents	O
expect	O
their	O
children	O
to	O
be	O
outstanding	O
and	O
successful	O
.	O
In	O
order	O
to	O
achieve	O
this,	O
they	O
start	O
cultivating	O
their	O
children	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
young	O
.	O
In	O
addition	O
to	O
basic	O
knowledge	O
like	O
language	O
or	O
science,	O
music	O
and	O
art	O
are	O
usually	O
on	O
the	O
must-learn	O
list	O
of	O
the	O
parents	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
children	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
age	Arg_I
because	O
they	Arg_B
do	Arg_I
contribute	Arg_I
several	Arg_I
merits	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
First,	O
it's	Arg_B
very	Arg_I
suitable	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
develop	Arg_I
senses	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
.	O
Children	Arg_B
absorb	Arg_I
things	Arg_I
quickly	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
bear	Arg_I
exact	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
ability	Arg_I
needed	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
art-imagination	Arg_I
.	O
Music	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
math	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
language	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
strict	Arg_I
rules	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
abstract,	Arg_I
requiring	Arg_I
creativity	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
imagination	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
enriched	Arg_I
.	O
Children	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
privileged	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
abilities	Arg_I
because	O
they	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
given	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
freedom	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
imagination	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
yet	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
killed	Arg_I
due	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
reality	Arg_I
circumstances	Arg_I
.	O
Even	Arg_B
if	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
performances	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
simple	Arg_I
drawings	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
melodies,	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
bring	Arg_I
out	Arg_I
children's	Arg_I
joy	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
flying	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
imagination	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
music	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
life-long	Arg_I
cultivation	Arg_I
worthy	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
investing	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
teach	Arg_I
us	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
appreciate	Arg_I
beauty	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
express	Arg_I
feelings	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
creative	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
essential	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
spiritual	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
even	Arg_B
if	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
going	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
musicians	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
artists,	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
still	Arg_I
worthy	Arg_I
because	O
it	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
nourish	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
temper	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
serve	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
leisure	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
some	O
people	O
might	O
argue	O
that	O
parents	O
shouldn't	O
put	O
so	O
much	O
stress	O
on	O
children,	O
since	O
learning	Arg_B
too	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
seems	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
burden	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
it	Arg_B
depends	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
value	Arg_I
these	Arg_I
learning	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
parents	Arg_I
push	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
5	Arg_I
years	Arg_I
old	Arg_I
child	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
play	Arg_I
piano	Arg_I
8	Arg_I
hours	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
day	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
professional	Arg_I
performer,	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
might	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
.	O
In	Arg_B
a	Arg_I
child	Arg_I
stage,	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
open	Arg_I
door	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
introduce	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
training	Arg_I
area	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
acquire	Arg_I
specific	Arg_I
skills	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
this	O
way,	O
it	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
such	Arg_I
pressure	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
young	Arg_B
age	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
perfect	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
children	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
music	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
and	O
they	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
indeed	Arg_I
valuable	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
young	Arg_I
stage,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
every	Arg_I
stage	Arg_I
.	O
Music	Arg_B
and	Arg_I
art	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
accompany	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
spirit	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
long	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
given	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I

enter	Arg_I
his/her	Arg_I

But	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
concerned,	O
I	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
idea,	O
which	O
is	O
that	O
there	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
decrease	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
cars	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
future	Arg_I
.	O
The	O
following	O
reasons	O
will	O
present	O
my	O
points	O
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
since	O
the	O
public	O
transportation	O
has	O
improved,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
much	Arg_I
convenience	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
subway	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
bus	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
I	Arg_B
live	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
city	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
jam	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
morning	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
doesn't	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
enough	Arg_I
parking	Arg_I
lots	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
cars	Arg_I
.	O
So,	O
with	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
stations	Arg_I
increased	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
willing	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
public	Arg_I
transportation	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
drive	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
a	Arg_B
driving	Arg_I
car	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
make	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
pollutions	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
world	Arg_I
.	O
So,	O
with	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
risen	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
aware	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
environment,	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
think	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
whether	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
drive	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
instead	Arg_B
of	Arg_I
driving	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
one's	Arg_I
car,	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
put	Arg_I
forty	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
bus,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
solve	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
traffic	Arg_I
jam	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
decrease	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
cars	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
reduce	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
air	Arg_I
pollution	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
city	Arg_I
.	O
Although,	O
I	O
am	O
agree	O
with	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
reducing	O
of	O
the	O
car	O

twenty	O

I	O
think	O
I	O

have	O
to	O
point	O
out	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
different	O
points	O
of	O
view	O

People	O
who	O
hold	O
different	O
opinion	O
may	O
argue	O
that	O
a	Arg_B
personal	Arg_I
car	Arg_I
uses	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
because	O
a	Arg_B
public	Arg_I

can't	Arg_I
meet	Arg_I
every	Arg_I

Of	O
course,	O
it	Arg_B
may	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
true	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
want	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
countryside	Arg_I

some	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
inconvenience	Arg_I
places	Arg_I

However,	O
no	Arg_B

you	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
going	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
somewhere	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
trip	Arg_I

you	Arg_I
just	Arg_I
simply	Arg_I
live	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
suburbs	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
on,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
always	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
ways	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I

you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
ride	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
bike,	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
even	Arg_I
walk	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
feet	Arg_I

It	Arg_B
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
helps	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
reduce	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
car	Arg_I
use,	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
your	Arg_I
health	Arg_I

In	O
this	O
way,	O
this	Arg_B
won't	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
problem	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
all	Arg_I

In	O

the	O

the	O

Working	O

This	O

the	O
question	O
whether	O
it's	O
better	O
working	O
at	O

with	O
a	O
computer	O
and	O
a	O
phone	O
than	O
working	O
at	O
the	O
company's	O
office	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
working	Arg_B
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
worse	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
less	Arg_I
efficient	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
office	Arg_I
.	O
First	O
of	O
all,	O
while	Arg_B
working	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
office,	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
interact	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
colleges	Arg_I
instantly	Arg_I
.	O
They	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
either	Arg_I
get	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
colleges	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
discuss	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
together	Arg_I
.	O
Think	Arg_B
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
big	Arg_I
project	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
on,	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
group	Arg_I
member	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
new	Arg_I
idea	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
project,	Arg_I
he/she	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
assemble	Arg_I
his/her	Arg_I
colleges	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
away	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
discuss	Arg_I
.	O
It's	Arg_B
more	Arg_I
efficient	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
straight-forward	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
talking	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
phone	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
another	O
example,	O
if	Arg_B
one’s	Arg_I
computer	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
Internet	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
any	Arg_I
breakdown,	Arg_I
he/she	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
call	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
MIS	Arg_I
staff	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
fix	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
working	Arg_B
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
many	Arg_I
disadvantages	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
doubt	Arg_I
lower	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
efficiency	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
works	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
people	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
easily	Arg_I
distracted	Arg_I
while	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
.	O
It's	Arg_B
hard	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
concentrate	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
grab	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
TV	Arg_I
remote	Arg_I
or	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
junk	Arg_I
foods	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
away	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
addition,	O
while	Arg_B
people	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
home,	Arg_I
there	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
no	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
supervising	Arg_I
them,	Arg_I
thus	Arg_I
raises	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
chance	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
loafing	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
people	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
work	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
likely	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
miss	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
events	Arg_I
happening	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
office,	Arg_I
like	Arg_I
some	Arg_I
announcements	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
boss	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
conclusion,	O
working	Arg_B
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
office	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
obviously	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
than	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
at	Arg_I
home	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
terms	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
efficiency	Arg_I
.	O
It	Arg_B
not	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
has	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
advantage	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
colleges	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
also	Arg_I
it	Arg_I
provides	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
real	Arg_I
working	Arg_I
atmosphere	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
never	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
grasped	Arg_I
if	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
choose	Arg_I

work	Arg_I
at	Arg_I

The	O
ability	O

mastering	Arg_I

learning	Arg_I
them	Arg_I

If	Arg_B
we	Arg_I

we	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

if	Arg_B
someone	Arg_I
wants	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
industrial	Arg_I

he	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
his	Arg_I

As	O
you	O
can	O
see,	O
studying	Arg_B
hard	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
important	Arg_I

One	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

factors	Arg_I

success	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I

effective	Arg_I
commuincation	Arg_I

By	Arg_B
relating	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
people,	Arg_I
we	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
likely	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
lot	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
friends	Arg_I
and	O
therefore	O
we	Arg_B
will	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
wide	Arg_I
network	Arg_I

communication	Arg_I

Commuincation	Arg_B

bring	Arg_I
many	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
if	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
need	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
getting	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
job,	Arg_I
by	Arg_I
commuincating	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
people	Arg_I
offering	Arg_I
jobs	Arg_I
whom	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
treat	Arg_I
well	Arg_I
and	O
therefore	O
they	Arg_B
respect	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
well,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
achieve	Arg_I
your	Arg_I

Or,	O
if	Arg_B
you	Arg_I

by	Arg_I

The	Arg_B
key	Arg_I

self-control	Arg_I

It	O
is	O
sure	O
that	O

always	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
products	Arg_I
so	Arg_I
tempting,	Arg_I
regardless	Arg_I

It	Arg_B

in	Arg_B
the	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

the	Arg_B

First,	O
when	Arg_B
students	Arg_I
learn	Arg_I
facts	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
in	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
ready	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
facing	Arg_I
problems	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
own	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

As	O
a	O
case	O
in	O
point,	O
more	Arg_B
information	Arg_I
about	Arg_I

would	Arg_I
make	Arg_I

more	Arg_I
familiar	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
real	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
other	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

As	O
a	O

they	Arg_B

out	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
school	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
solve	Arg_I
their	Arg_I

better	Arg_I

Second,	O
it	Arg_B
would	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
students'	Arg_I
social	Arg_I
behavior	Arg_I
.	O
If	Arg_B
students	Arg_I
only	Arg_I
rely	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
concepts	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
ideas	Arg_I
theorically,	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
realize	Arg_I
human's	Arg_I

very	Arg_I

They	Arg_B
should	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

Thus,	O
if	Arg_B
they	Arg_I
deal	Arg_I

they	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
realize	Arg_I

these	Arg_B

when	Arg_B

in	Arg_I
students'	Arg_I

In	O
the	O
following,	O
I	O
will	O
state	O
my	O
reason	O
for	O
this	O
choice	O
.	O
First,	O
besides	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
good	Arg_I
body	Arg_I
shape,	Arg_I
sports	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
vital	Arg_I
effects	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
human's	Arg_I
healthfulness	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
my	O
viewpoint,	O
our	Arg_B
body	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
moral	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
depend	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
physical	Arg_I
activities	Arg_I
directly	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
a	O
case	O
in	O
point,	O
last	Arg_B
month	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
had	Arg_I
very	Arg_I
difficult	Arg_I
exam	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
forced	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
study	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
week	Arg_I
back	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
back	Arg_I
.	O
After	Arg_B
that	Arg_I
exam,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
felt	Arg_I
depressed	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
exhausted	Arg_I
.	O
Therefore,	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
gym	O
to	O
recuperate	O
and	O
it	O
responded	O
very	O
well!	O
As	O
a	O
result,	O
sports	Arg_B
are	Arg_I
necessary	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
acquire	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
energy	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
health	Arg_I
.	O
Second,	O
besides	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
academic	Arg_I
knowledge,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
awareness	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
social	Arg_I
behavior	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
important	Arg_I
factor	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
human's	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
a	O
practical	O
epitome,	O
students	Arg_B
should	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
prepared	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
present	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
society	Arg_I
after	Arg_I
their	Arg_I
graduation	Arg_I
.	O
Thus	O
social	Arg_B
activities	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
help	Arg_I
them	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
familiar	Arg_I
with	Arg_I
other's	Arg_I
mind	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
different	Arg_I
environment	Arg_I
.	O
In	O
my	O
opinion,	O
social	Arg_B
groups	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
classes	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
significant	Arg_I
factors	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
prepare	Arg_I
students	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
contribute	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
discussion	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
encounter	Arg_I
real	Arg_I
social	Arg_I
environment	Arg_I
.	O
So,	O
social	Arg_B
activities	Arg_I
have	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
rights	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
receive	Arg_I
monetary	Arg_I
support	Arg_I
.	O
Moreover,	O
they	Arg_B
bring	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
students	Arg_I

For	O
example,	O
everyone	Arg_B

Secondly,	O

For	O

Evaluating	Arg_B
teachers	Arg_I

performance	Arg_I

For	O

Students	Arg_B
might	Arg_I
complain	Arg_I

their	Arg_I

that	Arg_I

not	Arg_I
catch	Arg_I
up	Arg_I

Consequently,	O
teachers	Arg_B

make	Arg_I

Therefore,	O
evaluating	Arg_B

Additionally,	O
this	Arg_B

the	Arg_I

a	Arg_B

should	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I

for	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
goals	Arg_I

Firstly,	O
committing	Arg_B
to	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
goal	Arg_I
helps	Arg_I
creating	Arg_I
personal	Arg_I
worth	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
example,	O
I	Arg_B
realized	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
true	Arg_I
potential	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
body	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
mind	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
decided	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
train	Arg_I
myself	Arg_I
hard	Arg_I

Even	Arg_B
if	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
were	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
win	Arg_I
this	Arg_I
medal,	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
acknowledged	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
amount	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
endeavor	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
could	Arg_I
keep	Arg_I
my	Arg_I
tired	Arg_I
legs	Arg_I
running	Arg_I

Secondly,	O
one	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
learns	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
great	Arg_I
difficulty	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
become	Arg_I
stronger	Arg_I
.	O
I	Arg_B
remembered	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
suffered	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
first	Arg_I
round	Arg_I
when	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
was	Arg_I
last	Arg_I
person	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
touched	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
line	Arg_I
.	O
However,	O
I	Arg_B
did	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
give	Arg_I
up,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
believed	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
I	Arg_I
would	Arg_I
be	Arg_I
better	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
next	Arg_I
round	Arg_I
because	O
I	Arg_B
knew	Arg_I
how	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
improve	Arg_I
myself	Arg_I

I	Arg_B
had	Arg_I
been	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
loser	Arg_I
for	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
thousand	Arg_I
time	Arg_I
before	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
first	Arg_I
winning,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
suffering	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
losing	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
each	Arg_I
competition	Arg_I
makes	Arg_I
me	Arg_I
stronger	Arg_I

Thirdly,	O
at	O
some	O
point,	O
we,	Arg_B
as	Arg_I
an	Arg_I
average	Arg_I
people,	Arg_I
might	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
responsibility	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
our	Arg_I
goal	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
too	Arg_I
heavy	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
carry	Arg_I
on	Arg_I
.	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
responsibility	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
worthy	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
carrying	Arg_I
.	O
When	Arg_B
the	Arg_I
distance	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
longer	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
harder	Arg_I
to	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
runner	Arg_I
who	Arg_I
can	Arg_I
go	Arg_I
beyond	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
limit	Arg_I
will	Arg_I
proud	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
himself	Arg_I
.	O
He	Arg_B
can	Arg_I
feel	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
sweetness	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
triumph	Arg_I
because	O
he	Arg_B
did	Arg_I
not	Arg_I
stop	Arg_I
pursing	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
goal	Arg_I
.	O
For	O
these	O
reasons,	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
one	O
should	O
not	O
give	O
up,	O
as	O
the	Arg_B
true	Arg_I
reward	Arg_I

to	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
dignity	Arg_I
.	O
Anyone	Arg_B
who	Arg_I
wants	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
achieve	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
goal	Arg_I
should	Arg_I
acknowledge	Arg_I
that	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
effort	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
experience	Arg_I
from	Arg_I
suffering	Arg_I
helps	Arg_I
him	Arg_I
understand	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
true	Arg_I
potential	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
increase	Arg_I
his	Arg_I
strength,	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
ultimately,	Arg_I
it	Arg_I

him	Arg_I

By	Arg_B
attending	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

such	Arg_B
financial	Arg_I
help	Arg_I

usually	Arg_I
far	Arg_I

In	O
such	O
case,	O
aids	Arg_B
from	Arg_I
more	Arg_I
capable	Arg_I

citizens	Arg_I

Another	Arg_B

children	Arg_B
might	Arg_I

evidence	Arg_I
about	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
reduction	Arg_I

the	Arg_I

because	O
of	O
many	O
reasons	O
.	O
Firstly,	O
capital	Arg_B
punishment	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
form	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
revenge	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
creates	Arg_I
violent	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
.	O
Crimes	Arg_B
kill	Arg_I
someone	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
illegal;	Arg_I
nevertheless,	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
government	Arg_I
use	Arg_I
law	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
punish	Arg_I
them,	Arg_I
which	Arg_I
is	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
same	Arg_I
way	Arg_I
they	Arg_I
sinned	Arg_I
but	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
legal	Arg_I
one	Arg_I
.	O
As	O
a	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
criminal	O
is	O
repeated	O
second	O
time;	O
also,	O
it	Arg_B
is	Arg_I
regarded	Arg_I
as	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
"legalized	Arg_I
revenge"	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
victims'	Arg_I
family	Arg_I

Hence,	O
death	Arg_B
penalty	Arg_I
neither	Arg_I
controls	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
violent	Arg_I
in	Arg_I
society	Arg_I
nor	Arg_I
creates	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
violent	Arg_I
culture	Arg_I
.	O
Secondly,	O
nobody	Arg_B
has	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
right	Arg_I
to	Arg_I
take	Arg_I
another	Arg_I
human	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
.	O
It	O
is	O
undeniable	O
that	O
the	Arg_B
rights	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
life	Arg_I
are	Arg_I
the	Arg_I
basic	Arg_I
and	Arg_I
vital	Arg_I
rights	Arg_I

a	Arg_I
human	Arg_I
being	Arg_I

No	Arg_B

If	Arg_B
you	Arg_I
kill	Arg_I
a	Arg_I
criminal,	Arg_I
you	Arg_I

Moreover,	O
if	Arg_B
we	Arg_I

that	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
best	Arg_I
way	Arg_I

solve	Arg_I
the	Arg_I

neither	Arg_I

the	Arg_I
capital	Arg_I

Finally,	O
with	Arg_B
some	Arg_I
of	Arg_I
serious	Arg_I

capital	Arg_I

an	Arg_I

They	Arg_B

any	Arg_I

something	Arg_I

capital	O

a	O
